EVTDESCpilgrim.1;You have decided to go on a pilgrimage to seek [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s grace at one of His holy places. There are several different places that you could visit on your pilgrimage. All of them are considered most sacred, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.1;I will go to Novigrad, His final resting place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBpilgrim.1;I will go to Ard Ghlais, the place where He died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCpilgrim.1;I will go to Lan Exeter, the center of His teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDpilgrim.1;Actually, I changed my mind, I won't go anywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.10;My things are packed, everything is in order. At the end of my journey the great city of Novigrad awaits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEpilgrim.11;Novigrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.11;You have finally arrived at the great city of Novigrad! The Novigrad, one of the largest cities of the world, lies on the mighty river Pontar, and busy commerce mingles with the flow of pilgrims. The [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s remains rest in temple of Barwice, recovered from the feces of dragon that devoured Him. The temple that guard the remains is not an impressive structure, nonetheless thousands of followers of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] visit it every year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.11;A great city indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.12;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon, I shall see the place where [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] left this world at the hands of dragon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEpilgrim.13;Ard Ghlais;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.13;You have finally arrived at Ard Ghlais! It unimportant place in middle of nowhere, even it's lords consider it unimportant, yet for the followers of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] it is one of their most sacred places. Here Saint Lebioda was eaten by a green dragon, here His followers labored for days and nights until they recovered His remains, every last bone, from the feces of the dragon. But there is only small shine to mark these important events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.13;He died to soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.14;My things are packed, everything is in order. Soon I will stand at the center of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEpilgrim.15;Lan Exeter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.15;You have finally arrived at the city of Lan Exeter! It is the largest city north of Novigrad and the heart of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s worship. There are many temples built in His name, there are many priests preaching His wisdom written in the Good Book, there are many philosophers debating the same wisdom and their true meaning, there is never-ending flow of faithful pilgrim visiting the city. Everywhere you turn you can learn something new about [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.15;You can't see such sight every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.35;You have finally returned from your pilgrimage. It went great, you even met [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] himself, but He threatened you with knife robbed you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.35;Maybe I shouldn't have taken those drugs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.100;The rain has been pouring down for days, it's almost impossible to travel the roads. Why does the [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] punish his faithful pilgrims so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCpilgrim.300;As you walk around on this holy ground, you ponder the teachings of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], they have never felt more relevant to you than now. Imagine the knowledge contained and wisdom He could tell you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.300;The way of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is through study.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.301;This holy ground, how it all moves my soul! I realize now that all my life up to this point has only been a preparation for this journey. How wondrous that the light of the [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] truly shines in me, a poor sinner. From now on I shall always do His work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.303;As you approach the temple, you overhear a theological discussion between several priests. You stop and eagerly engage them in conversation, expanding upon several of your favorite topics. They are very impressed by your knowledge and invite you to hold a lecture for a group of assembled religious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.304;The bustling mass of pilgrims, merchants and travellers is impressive, as are the many languages, colors and ways of dress present. People come here from north and south. You are standing at a place where the roads meet, and that is where people and ideas meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.305;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you came here, to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]'s final resting place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.307;This city is bustling with both pilgrims, travellers and merchants from all over the world, and a myriad of accents mingle in the parks and plazas. In this great cultural melting pot, should there not also be room for me to express who I really am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.308;This magnificent temple built in your honor! Oh the glory! And all these pilgrims - finally you may revel in their adulation. Perhaps you should reveal yourself to the masses who have come to worship you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.309;You have come to visit the holy site and show your devotion. But surely, there is no harm in having a little fun first?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.310;Blasphemous fools! Do they not know [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]? How dare they throw you out of your own final resting place?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCpilgrim.318;You were a bit lost when you came upon a shady man, he offered you "chance of a lifetime", but your expert eye could recognize drug dealer as soon as you saw him. You were right, the man was selling fisstech.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.318;Well, why not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.318;No, in unfamiliar city who knows in which ditch will I wake up or if I wake up at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCpilgrim.319;You woke up in a ditch behind the temple of Barwice. You remember how you bought some fisstech, everything after that was a bit blurry, but you are certain that you talked with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] and that He had a knife and He threatened and robbed you. Then something hit your head from behind and everything went blank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTApilgrim.319;Damn Lebioda, how dare He rob me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
