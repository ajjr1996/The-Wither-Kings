EVTDESClifestyle.1;A book called 'Basics of Alchemy' has found it's way in your hands. After reading the book for a bit you find the subject of alchemy somewhat intriguing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlifestyle.1;I'll have to get some more books... and ingredients;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlifestyle.1;No, I have heard alchemy is dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClifestyle.1;I will not do something so ungodly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClifestyle.2;After studying various tomes and books of alchemy and making some simple potions by following the recipes you feel ready to do something more complicated. Browsing the recipes you have, White Raffard's decoction catches your eyes, the potion is simple enough and you have most of the ingredients at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlifestyle.2;Ok, first I need to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlifestyle.2;Hmm, a healing potion sounds interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClifestyle.3;White Raffard's decoction, the potion you are currently making requires some hydragenum. The recipe suggests using diamond dust as source for pure hydragenum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlifestyle.3;In this world nothing comes free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlifestyle.3;If I remember correctly cortinarius mushrooms are also good source for hydragenum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClifestyle.3;That's too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClifestyle.4;After collecting cortinarius mushrooms you try to extract hydragenum with a few different methods. Leaving the mushrooms in a strong alcohol for a day and afterwards using the alcohol as hydragenum source seems to worked the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlifestyle.4;That work well, I should remember it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClifestyle.5;Having procured pure hydragenum, the remaining step weren't much of a problem and soon after you had a White Raffard's decoction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlifestyle.5;Finally I can proudly call myself an alchemist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
