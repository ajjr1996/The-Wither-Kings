EVTDESC100180;It's hard being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] these days, but my friend truly shocked me when I realized we did not share the same religion. My dear friend is a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC100181;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a devout [From.Religion.GetName], so when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I believed in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] rather than [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I knew what [From.GetSheHe] was going to say. After a long, heated discussion about religion, considered disadvantages and advantages of our respective religions I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
