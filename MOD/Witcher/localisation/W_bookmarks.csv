BM_WITCHER_2_ERA_INFO;The kingdoms of man groan, their foundations weak. An assassin has claimed the life of Aedirn�s King Demavend, and a slew of souls claw at his empty seat. King Henselt of Kaedwen prepares his armies to march on the Pontar for a second time in his reign, all the while a woman known as Saskia the Dragonslayer rushes to the valley's defense with her army of peasants and non-humans. The rightful heir, Prince Stennis, can only tolerate her intrusion as he scrambles to defend Aedirn and control the crown.\nTemeria fares no better. Only a short time after the Flaming Rose and Scoia�tael ripped each other apart in her streets, the country is once again embroiled in civil war, Foltest battling his nobles for control of his own heirs. Thus does the north shatter, and Nilfgaard watches in silence�;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_NAME_24999;King Foltest;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_24999;You're moving to capture the stronghold of the rebellious Aryan La Valette, whose mother Mary Louisa La Valette was your mistress and bore you two illegitimate children Boussy and Ana�s. You've denied everything, which pushed the La Valette to stir up rebellion among the barons and declare the independence of La Valette lands from Temeria.\nAny weakness could prove fatal, with the threat of the Nilfgaard Empire looming over your Kingdom. Can you find a way to secure the succession of the Temerian throne ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_20211;Aryan La Valette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_20211;You're the son of the old baron La Valette and Mary Louisa La Valette, who became the mistress of King Foltest. With the King refusing to acknowledge your half-brother Boussy and half-sister Ana�s and ridiculing your mother, it was a disgrace for your dynasty.\nYou've stirred up rebellion among the barons, hoping to weaken the crown and obtain new privileges. Maria has declared the independence of La Valette lands from Temeria, and placed you in command of her subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_15000;King Henselt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_15000;Once again, war threatens to engulf Aedirn and the Pontar Valley, past atrocities and treaties alike cast aside in the name of ambition. The death of King Demavend has emboldened you, as you have finally returned to claim your right and bring an end to his battle for the land rightfully called Lormark.\nHowever, Upper Aedirn does not remain idle. Years of repression and racism have inspired a unified rebellion among the lesser classes, led by Saskia the Dragonslayer, all ready to defend and reform their homeland. Furthermore, Demavend�s son, Prince Stennis, can still claim rightful rule and challenge any aggression. A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_9700;Saskia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_9700;The plight and suffering of commoners and non-humans have at last reached the ears of a savior with the strength to annihilate their oppressors. Already local tyrants fall, and the people unite as one around you, Saskia the Dragonslayer. But now, instead of brandishing blades against you, nobles curry your favor, for a great evil has crossed into the Pontar Valley.\nKing Henselt�s ambitions knows no bounds, and he salivates at the thought of conquering Upper Aedirn and avenging his loss. Ever valiant, you move to defend the people under the joint banner of Prince Stennis, but doubt grips your allies. A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_NAME_9025;Prince Stennis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_9025;The death of your father King Demavend has ruptured the fragile peace. Unrest reigns in Upper Aedirn thanks to the efforts of Saskia the Dragonslayer, gathering a horde of nonhumans and peasants in her crusade for anarchy, but her threat is dwarfed by the arrival of King Henselt of Kaedwen, amassing over five thousand troops along the border, just waiting for your move.\nA homegrown rebel is more trustworthy than a kingly claimant, so you have briefly allied with Saskia, hoping her legend will be weight you can use against Henselt. But, Prince Stennis, can you really unite your vassals and show the world your strength while beholden to another? A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

You've dispatched assassins to trigger chaos in the North, while putting the last touch to your invasion plans.\nAt home, you've crushed all plots against you and acted ruthlessly toward traitors. Can you actually succeed, or has the Empire reached its limit ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
