EVTNAMEtnw.1;Velen aftermath;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1;The Battle of Velen ended inconclusively, we stopped the Nilfgardians but suffered heavy losses. The Emperor will return soon with reinforcements. We must quickly rebuild our army to face the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1;Eternal Fire will support our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1;We need to find allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.100;Temerian aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.100;After the death of King Foltest, his kingdom disintegrated. The divided nobility could not resist the invasion from the south. Now all of Temeria is under the control of the Nilfgaard, and Emhyr sits on the throne in Wyzim. However, there are still people loyal to the old king, hoping to restore freedom to Temeria. Vernon Roche is ready to help us in our struggle against Emhyr, if we give him guarantees that after the war Temeria will keep its independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.100;Temeria will reclaim its freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.100;We will defeat the blacks without your help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.101;Skelige;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.101;An island country inhabited by pirates, strong warriors and men of honour. We never liked each other, but they definitely hate the Nilfgaardians and should understand that if we lose, they will be next in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.101;Ask to join the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.101;We don't need pirates on our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.102;Kovir and Poviss;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.102;During the Second Northern War, Kovir and Poviss maintained nutrality, but assisted us financially. We are the last obstacle standing between Nilfgaard and Kovir. Perhaps we could convince them to break their neutrality and join us before it is too late?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.102;Ask for support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.102;Redania will manage itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.200;Witch hunt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.200;Sorceresses, mages, witches and other users of magic are the reason why we find ourselves in the current situation. The Lodge of Sorceresses, under the leadership of Filippa, ordered the assassination of Foltest and Demavend, preparing the way for the Nilfgaard invasion. The recent Loc Muine summits have only shown that the wizards are power-hungry manipulators who plot against us. After these events, all the wizards associated with the Lodge are wanted, but perhaps we should take care of all the wizards?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.200;Leave them for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.200;Aresst everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.200;Burn! Burn! Burn!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.201;Flaming Rose Order;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.201;During the first phase of the war, the Order of the Flaming Rose suffered devastating losses and is on the verge of collapse. Perhaps it no longer makes sense for the Order to stay in Redani if it can no longer offer us military support?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.201;Confiscate the property and incorporate the knights into Witch Hunters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.201;Maybe they will still prove useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.201;Help them rebuild their strength.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.202;Keira Metz;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.202;Who would have thought that a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses would come to me on her own? Keira Metz has brought behind her notes on Catriona plague and claims she can help us create a powerful weapon to fight Nilfgaard, in exchange for a pardon of her Lodge association.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.202;Perhaps you are the only sorceress we can trust.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.202;I'll never trust a witch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.202;Do you take me for a fool?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.203;Novigrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.203;The Hierarch of Novigrad understood that we were the only ones who could stop the infidel armies from the south. With Novigrad's support we should win this war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.203;Time to push the blacks out of the North.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.1000;Victory of the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1000;Thanks to your tactical genius, Redania defeated the invader from the south. Now is the time to decide the fate of the North. Should we return to the old order before the war? Or should the North be united under your leadership? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1000;The North is finally free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1000;It's a bad day for the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTCtnw.1000;The North should unite under the redanian eagle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTNAMEtnw.1001;Conquest of North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESCtnw.1001;Redania's defeat ended the Third War of the North. The Nilfgaard Empire has achieved its goal, there is no one left who could oppose our power. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTAtnw.1001;The world belongs to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTBtnw.1001;The North is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
