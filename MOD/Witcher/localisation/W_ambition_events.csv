EVTDESCambition.3;After waiting patiently for potion to take effect you suddenly felt... you don't know how to describe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.3;It actually worked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.4;After waiting patiently for potion to take effect nothing happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.4;I have been cheated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.10;You have gotten your hands on a book that contains instructions for a ritual supposed to cure infertility. The book is quite old and bound in black leather, the title reads "Ponape Scripture";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.10;For the ritual I need....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBambition.20;Who can trust the rumours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.21; After searching for the alchemist far and wide you have finally found him. The alchemist explained that although the is finished potion it is untested, he did pay a witcher some while ago to test the potion and report back to him when he will be in area but he hasn't heard of witcher ever since...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.21;I will drink the potion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCambition.22;Some time have passed since you drank the potion, although you can't feel any changes you get the feeling the potion actually did work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.22;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.23;After drinking the potion you start feeling sick. Seems like the potion didn't work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.23;Ugh...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.30;Searching for ways to heal infertility have lead you to a safe albeit expensive procedure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.30;No amount is too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPambition.31;Take the procedure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAambition.31;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.40;There are rumours that Mecopteran bones can cure impotence. You just need to get the hand bones from the creature, crush them and make soup from powered and you are cured. Well, according to a rumour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.40;I should buy the bones, maybe they'll really work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPambition.41;Gather Mecopteran hand bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBambition.40;I will hunt for one myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCambition.40;Actually, I have never heard of this cure working before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.41;It took some time but you have gotten your hands on Mecopteran hands. I'm sure the beastie won't miss them too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.41;Now to make the soup.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
use_bones;Prepare the bones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.42;Who knew, the soup made from Mecopteran hand bones actually worked.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.42;There is some truth in rumours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.43;It seems like the soup made from Mecopteran hand bones really can't cure infertility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.43;Well it was just a rumour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCambition.102;I dined with my liege and now the two of us have agreed to go hunting together within the fortnight. I think this is the beginning to a beautiful friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.103;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a great time at supper, but [From.GetSheHe] refused my kind offer to go hunting together. Perhaps another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.110;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps one of my courtiers will entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.110;Let's see what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBambition.110;I'm not interested in these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.111;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came by to talk with me today. We discussed many interesting subjects and [From.GetFirstName] seemed to be quite pleased. [From.GetSheHe] suggested perhaps we should meet for a bottle of wine sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.111;That sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCambition.112;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was interesting to talk to, and [From.GetSheHe] responded positively to the suggestion that we should drink together. I think I've made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.113;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't seem to interested in being friends. Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.120;My liege seems bored these days. Perhaps I should invite him to practice fencing with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBambition.120;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.121;I was sitting alone when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to spar with him. I had a lot of fun, but [From.GetFirstName] bested me in most of our bouts. I should ask him to help me train!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.121;Teach me to be a duelist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBambition.121;It's too tiring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.122;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I became friends, we should duel sometime again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.123;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't find fencing interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCambition.130;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps I will find somebody in the court to entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAambition.130;Let's see what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBambition.130;I'm not interested in these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
