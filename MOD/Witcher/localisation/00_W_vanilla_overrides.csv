EVTDESC100180;It's hard being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] these days, but my friend truly shocked me when I realized we did not share the same religion. My dear friend is a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100180;I shall try to convert my friend to the one true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP100181;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] tries to convert [This.GetTitledFirstName] to a God-fearing [Root.Religion.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB100180;Who cares about religion anyway? I don't!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP100182;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] accepts that [This.GetTitledFirstName] is a [This.Religion.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP100184;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is no longer friends with [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100181;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is a devout [From.Religion.GetName], so when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I believed in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] rather than [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I knew what [From.GetSheHe] was going to say. After a long, heated discussion about religion, considered disadvantages and advantages of our respective religions I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100181;...keep my religion but lose my friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP100185;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] cannot be friends with someone who does not respect [Root.GetHerHis] religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC100182;I feared what [From.GetTitledFirstName] would say when I told [From.GetHerHim] that I did not believe in [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName], that I am a devout [Root.Religion.GetName] and I would not give up my religion for anyone. [From.GetTitledFirstName] was more understanding than I would've thought [From.GetHerHim] to be, and after asking some questions [From.GetSheHe] seemed to accept me and my religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100182;A friend like you is hard to find, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100184;It went exactly as I had feared - [From.GetTitledFirstName] couldn't accept me being a [Root.Religion.GetName] and condemned me and my religion.

EVTOPTA100184; [From.GetTitledFirstName] decided [From.GetSheHe] couldn't be friends with a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100185;I tried talking to [From.GetTitledFirstName], discuss, argue, everything! Nothing I said, nothing I did could convince [From.GetTitledFirstName] to abandon [From.GetHerHis] heretical ways and embrace the one true faith, the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion. Our disagreement about religion were never solved and [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me I was no longer [From.GetHerHis] friend...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA100185;I agree, we can no longer be friends;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100186;The difference between a [Root.Religion.GetName] and a [From.Religion.GetName] is that...'\nI reasoned with [From.GetTitledFirstName] about [From.GetHerHis] religion and tried to explain why being a [From.Religion.GetName] in this day and age was a bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
