EVTNAMEaok.1;Defiance of La Valette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1;The kingdom of Temeria is in turmoil. The mother of your bastard children Bussy and Anais, Maria Luiza La Valette has given in to ambitious lords that wish to put them on your throne for their own benefit. They have declared war on you led by Luisa's son Arjan La Valette.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1;Those traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.2;Defiance of La Valette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.2;King Foltest's rule can't last no longer, he has defiled my mother, spent the coffers of Temeria for selfish needs. This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.2;For honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.3;Arjan La Valette has been cornered with just a handful of men remaining. It is a good chance to resolve this pointless war peacefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.3;Surrender, Arjan! You will be treated with honour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPaok.4;Demand surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.3;Cut them all down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.4;The king offers you a chance to surrender, promising to forgive and treat you with honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.4;Drop your weapons, men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.4;Go plough yourself, King!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.5;The mighty castle of La Valette has fallen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.5;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.6;The war is over, the castle has fallen and my children are safe and outside of reach of ambitious lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.6;They are my children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.6;I will not leave them in hands of traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCaok.6;The war is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.7;Send the Witcher;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.7;Send my marshal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAMEaok.1003;The Unicorn Returns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1003;Once again, war threatens to engulf Aedirn and the Pontar Valley, past atrocities and treaties alike cast aside in the name of ambition. Although the last war ended in the fiery retribution of the witch Sabrina Glevissig, that is all the more reason to press forward and bring honor to the fallen dead. The death of King Demavend has emboldened you, as you have finally returned to claim your right and finally bring an end to his battle for the land rightfully called Lormark, and perhaps much more.\nHowever, Upper Aedirn does not remain idle. Years of repression and racism have inspired a unified rebellion among the lesser classes, led by Saskia the Dragonslayer, all ready to defend and reform their homeland. Furthermore, Demavend’s son, Prince Stennis, can still claim rightful rule and challenge any aggression. A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1003;Continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1000;Prelude to War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1000;The nobles of Aedirn tremble at the thought of your return, and already they conspire against each other. Prince Stennis’ position is tenuous at best, juggling the demands of his nobles and the grievances of the peasants in the wake of his father’s death. With the disciplined forces of Kaedwen at your command, already greater in number, none shall bar your path.\nWell, in theory. Although unlikely, Stennis could find support from the other kingdoms, and he has the vaunted walls of Vergen on his side. Equally troublesome is the peasant and non-human rebellions engineered by Saskia, a wildcard of unknown power, and a threat to any monarch. Even if you win the war, Kaedwen might not emerge unscathed. Is your advantage best used to press for a victory through diplomatic channels, or shall war once again rain down upon the Pontar Valley?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1000;Peacs, they will self-destruct soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1000;I will take what I want by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1004;The Dragon has arisen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1004;The plight and suffering of commoners and non-humans have at last reached the ears of a savior with the strength to annihilate their oppressors. Already local tyrants fall, and the people unite as one around you, Saskia the Dragonslayer. But now, instead of brandishing blades against you, nobles curry your favor, for a great evil has crossed into the Pontar Valley.\nKing Henselt’s ambitions knows no bounds, and he salivates at the thought of conquering Upper Aedirn and avenging his loss. Ever valiant, you move to defend the people under the joint banner of Prince Stennis, but doubt grips your allies. A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1004;Continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1001;You walk side by side with Demavend’s heir, fulfilling the role of bodyguard... for now. Henselt has little need for assassins, for already he has brought his elite soldiers into the valley, drawing ever close to Vergen. No doubt you will encounter the blackheart soon, but how does a hero of the weak deal with a tyrant from afar?\nThe possibilities swirl in your mind. You could shout down the king and prepare for righteous war, but at great and terrible cost no matter the victor. You could listen to Henselt’s offer, but passivity will certainly weaken your position. Or...you could leave the talks to Stennis, and let the nobles believe they have the power, your hands clean of this unholy mess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1001;Henselt is a pig, but perhaps he can be reasoned with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1001;Henselt will not give up, we must strike first!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCaok.1001;I will wait and see how talks unfold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1005;Aedirn rots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1005;The death of your father King Demavend has ruptured the fragile peace. Unrest reigns in Upper Aedirn thanks to the efforts of Saskia the Dragonslayer, gathering a horde of nonhumans and peasants in her crusade for anarchy, but her threat is dwarfed by the arrival of King Henselt of Kaedwen, amassing over five thousand troops along the border, just waiting for your move.\nA homegrown rebel is more trustworthy than a kingly claimant, so you have briefly allied with Saskia, hoping her legend will be weight you can use against Henselt. But, Prince Stennis, can you really unite your vassals and show the world your strength while beholden to another? A bloody star rises over this old field of battle, and the spirits tremble in their wake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1005;Continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1002;Time is running out. As if reports of Henselt's army moving across the ford was concerning enough, several nobles that have been missing and were reported seen in Upper Aedirn, perhaps seeking a backroom deal with Henselt. With Saskia at your side, you make haste to the Pontar Valley to put an end to this treachery and learn what Henselt really wants.\nYes, everything depends on Henselt, but what do you desire? This could be your chance to establish yourself as a gallant or formidable king, one either respected or feared by his vassals. Henselt has the advantage, true, and an ordinary man would not dare stoke his ire. But, there can be great value in risk...and perhaps even a chance to kill two birds with one stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1002;Maybe Henselt will see reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1002;Henselt forces will break against the walls of Vergen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1020;Peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1020;Though reluctant, Prince Stennis finally saw reason and has entered into more intricate negotiations. Though he stubbornly holds onto Upper Aedirn, you were offered a generous compensation, Aedirn’s coffers laid bare to appease the might of your armies. These riches will expand your base of power, and who knows? Stennis will have to deal with Saskia soon. One day, civil war will tear Aedirn and her armies apart, and you’ll be right there across the border, waiting, fortified, and very, very, rich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1020;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1021;The nobility actually managed something. Henselt acknowledged both the strength brought by you, the Dragonslayer, and the walls of Vergen. Though Aedirn would give a monetary sacrifice, the lands will be spared a foreign invasion, allowing everyone to leave at full strength. Stennis did not disappoint, but that does not make him your ally. Unless reforms are passed and the people allowed the freedom they deserve, one day, your ideals will clash. Now the true “game” begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1021;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1022;Despite his pompous bluster, Henselt truly aimed for peace, using his army intimidate rather than invade, cautious of your fortifications and willingness to work with peasant rebels. You took advantage of his good mood and showered the proud Kaedweni king with precious Aedirnian gold. It is perhaps a temporary peace, but long enough to reign in your vassals and establish your legitimate rule. And, most important of all, long enough to figure out a way to deal with the infamous rebel standing by your side. If Aedirn is to be united then, one day, Prince Stennis must fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1022;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1030;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1030;Though you never intended to negotiate, the chaos surpassed your expectations. Guards slaughtered guards, priests ran about helpless, and you endured a grim struggle against Saskia the Dragonslayer, blood drawn on both sides. You survived, and pure rage and adrenaline null the pain of your wounds. You send out the message to summon every last one of  your troops across the ford, the beginning of a grand campaign. Vergen WILL fall, the stain of Pontar will be erased, and soon, the lush provinces of Aedirn will belong to the Unicorn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1030;Fire and damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1031;Stennis had backbone, one that Henselt did not appreciate. Surprising even you, Stennis proved his pride and honor by dueling Henselt for the sake of all Aedirn. However, the melee too chaotic, and the two rulers far too evenly matched. When Henselt staggered back to his guards you rushed in and rescued a wounded Stennis, cleaving your way through Henselt’s minions and rushing him safely to Vergen. Perhaps the two of you can work together after all...time will tell. For now, you both fight for the people, to protect them from a filthy Kaedweni swine who calls himself king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1031;Aedirn shall endure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1032;Henselt proved himself a demon, but you already steeled yourself, ready for his claws. You risked everything on a chance to slay him on that ground, the stuff of legend if it had worked. But, reality is never so simple. The battle quickly ended under a maelstrom of chaos, and Saskia barely managed to extract you safely. Aedirn was destined for war after all, a grave and terrible encore. However, you have earned the trust of the Dragonslayer, and still have the protection of Vergen. King Henselt gravely underestimated you, and now he will pay the price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1032;Damn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1040;Peace?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1040;You may have misjudged your enemy. Henselt compliments your aggressive stance in wanting defend your land, and admits he does not necessarily seek war. There are other ways to secure a lasting peace between our nations he says, and you realize that Kaedwen can be bought out with excess gold and promises, a reinterpretation of the old treaty rather than the destruction of it. A small sacrifice would be enough to avoid war, though it would do no favors to your own prestige. Should Aedirn treat with Henselt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1040;If he wants peace, I'm obliged to comply for Aedirn's sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1040;Even if Henselt retreats he will be back, it's better to finish it now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1041;The Prince relents and agrees to your more than generous terms. Likely when he heard of your troop numbers across the river he had resigned himself to war, and was just putting on a strong face for his vassals. An impetuous youth, but perhaps he has promise? Either way, you return to Kaedwen satisfied, a perch to observe the chaos in the surrounding lands. Temeria has shattered, and Nilfgaard is eerily quiet. They deserve your attention far more than the peasant rabble of Aedirn…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1041;Hm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1042;The boy is insane! Even after offering an easy out to avoid war and deal with his country's internal issues, he still throws insults your way and vows to fight to the bitter end, promising that your Kaedweni soldiers shall falter before the walls of Vergen. A fine fairy tale! Though this was not your intention, you have all the motivation you need to gather your troops and set out for eternal glory. If Aedirn will not treat with you, then you’ll just have to take everything you ever dreamed of, and perhaps even more. Then, they’ll know the gravity of their mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1042;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1043;Seeing Henselt willing to negotiate, Stennis fumbled over his words and quickly changed his combative tone. Though you were forced to grit your teeth and watch the pathetic waltz of politics, the two nobles quickly approved a temporary peace between Kaedwen and Aedirn, one that had little effect on you, agreeable to all. Pathetic. Your blade seeks the hearts of tyrants, but finds only a pair of slippery mice who run to a corner at the first sign of battle. You remain quiet for now, but the dragon-hearted “Dragonslayer” only bides her time…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1043;Hm...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1044;The Prince proves he has a pair of balls to go along with his precious noble honor. Stennis resists Henselt’s efforts to coax him into peace, understanding the grave insult Kaedwen had thrown at them. Stennis speaks much as you would have, and you have little to add but your protection, ensuring Henselt does not get any ideas. The two of you return to Vergen to make preparations for war, united in your desire to free Aedirn of this foreign scourge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1044;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1050;Can we still reach agreement?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1050;Henselt cut right through your evasive answers, threatening death upon all of Aedirn here and now if you did not give in to his demands. Saskia almost challenged him right there, but you kept her muzzled for the time being... although Henselt expressed a deep interest in having her under his heel. What should be done? Give up on Upper Aedirn, offer him the rebel Saskia, or insist on bribing him out with money? You cannot avoid war without a sacrifice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1050;There will be no sacrifices... only war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1050;If giving up Upper Aedirn is only choice, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
henselt_decides_about_offer; Henselt will decide the worth of your offer\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCaok.1050;This could be perfect chance - getting rid of Saskia and ending the war at same time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDaok.1050;I'm willing to reimburse him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1053;An offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1053;Prince Stennis crumbles before you, willing to sacrifice luscious Upper Aedirn to prevent the complete fragmentation of his country. He has isolated himself from Saskia, playing right into your hand. Your intimidation has already won you a victory! Do you accept his gracious offer, or press forward to crush their obviously fragile alliance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1053;I knew the boy will break.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
henselt_accepts_offer;You accept Prince Stennis' offer\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1053;I take what I want... emhasis on TAKE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
henselt_declines_offer;You decline Prince Stennis' offer\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1054;Coaxed by your poisonous words, Stennis reveals his paranoia for the rebel leader beside him, willing to offer the traitorous woman as a prize to satisfy you. While this does intrigue you, you wonder if it is really worth letting the Pontar out of your grasp, even if only for a short time. Shall you humor Prince Stennis and accept what he obviously cannot give you, at least not without a fight...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1054;Lets see where this will go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1054;One woman is not worth the bounty of Lormark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1055;Stennis offers gold! A tired platitude, but the numbers have increased to a fair degree, enough that it would surely affect his rule and ability to control his vassals. It is not the optimal outcome, but you still know all too well how costly an assault on Vergen would be. Do you let them go for now, or crush them on the battlefield?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1055;I will have fund for the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1055;Why should I accept his cash, when I can take it together with Lormark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1056;You try and cut a deal with Stennis, but of course Saskia interrupts, quick to protect both herself and Upper Aedirn. Unfortunately, your guards are unable to subdue her, and she makes her way back to Vergen, the parley for naught...at least on the surface. Saskia will never trust Stennis again, and your dream of conquest draws closer and closer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1056;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1057;Caving to Henselt’s pressure, Stennis looks to sacrifice the land and people you have sworn to protect. This will not stand--it will not be allowed! Draw your sword and end this farce, Saskia! Your people need you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1057;Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1063;Stennis thinks to rid himself of your rebellion by throwing you to the wolves and caving to Henselt’s armies, turning Aedirn into a Kaedweni whore! Time to show these fools just how overwhelming your wrath can be. But, Stennis comes later. Henselt shall be first! The Pontar will not submit without a fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1063;Insanity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1058;Why did you not see this coming? Henselt feigns interest in your offer, ready to accept it at face value before Saskia flies into a rage and destroys the proceedings. No guards can contain the Dragonslayer, and for your failure to muzzle her Henselt declares war on the both of you anyway. Your valiant attempt to sacrifice Saskia and Upper Aedirn for the greater good has failed miserably, and now hatred permeates throughout the once united armies. With an army divided in loyalty, your chance of victory grows slimmer and slimmer, and Henselt emerges as the clear winner of this farce of a parley. However, you will not let one mistake destroy your rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1058;No one has won the war, not yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1059;Stennis tried to reason with the bloodthirsty king, but to no avail. Henselt wants war at any cost to avenge his own personal loss, a gaping wound in his pride. You will have to snuff out his ambition for good so he can finally join the old ghosts of the dead he left behind those years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1059;To war and victory!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1060;Your worst fears have been realized. Henselt ignores any and all pleas for peace, content to have another desperate struggle across the Pontar Valley. One could almost hear the ghosts whisper as blades were drawn on all sides, the war breaking out in earnest. You may have wished for a different outcome, but you are far more evenly matched than Henselt realizes. United with Saskia, you plan to give the Unicorn a rude awakening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1060;To war and victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1061;A round of aggressive diplomacy and everything just ends with money, typical of the nobility. Henselt’s greed spares the people of Aedirn a difficult war, and gives you time to consider your next move. Now you must consolidate and plot the proper path to achieving your ideals, mindful of these nobles and their games of politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1061;The world must change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1062;Gold, the lifeblood of a king ruling over his people, the very symbol of power, and now, the only thing you can trust to save you. For now, Henselt accepts your offer of compensation, and immediate war is avoided. No doubt the King of Kaedwen is banking on your eventual defeat, either by your own nobles or Saskia, giving him a second excuse to invade. But, even if robbed of your wealth, you vow to prove him wrong, and tame your traitorous vassals. With the gold now in Henselt’s hands, the blades of the Pontar turn inward. Can you emerge as a king worthy to rule the whole of Aedirn? No one yet knows, but many fools will die as you endeavor to make your mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1062;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1070;The parley is but a blur before your eyes now, recovering from a damned blow to the head. You had pushed Stennis into a corner, felt him so very close to cracking, but then the Dragonslayer jumped into the fray, insulting your honor and spitting on your titles... and then you fought... and the bandage says it did not go particularly well.\nBut you survived, and you know you have won. Kaedwen shall flood the Pontar with her troops, and King Henselt’s name shall be proclaimed across the world once again. Only a fool, a woman, and an abnormally high wall stands in your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1070;Damnation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1071;You reflect on the failed parley, now a haze in your mind. Were you really wounded by that accursed pig? A minor blow for you, but enough to prevent your triumph over Henselt in the melee; you could only scream in anger as he escaped. While Stennis fumbled and Henselt cornered him with cruelty, you had reached your limit of tolerance and rushed to fight the belligerent king. The parley failed, and he got away, too many guards, and admittedly, a strong sword arm, just enough to keep you at bay. No grand duels to decide the fate of this world. Now you raise up the wills of your people for this fateful war, to beat back the black tide of Kaedwen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1071;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1072;While you fumble for answers, Saskia jumps into the diplomatic fray, spewing vitriol to defend your honor. It appears she now views in a much more favorable light than Henselt, and while you agree with much of her rant, all hopes of negotiation have been thrown out the window.\nIt’s the following day now, and you barely remember the events, a flurry of swords and curses on all sides. Though groggy, you snap back to reality. You must lead your people, and forget all grudges with Saskia. Henselt is a power hungry demon who must be stopped, or your rule will never come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1072;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEaok.1100;The war has ended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1100;Your soldiers roar in triumph as the walls of Vergen burst open, flooding the city from the front and the underground tunnels below, a stroke of pure genius O’ great king. Your foes fought to the bitter end, but an end it shall be. You are redeemed, the soldiers who died in your name at last able to rest in peace.\nBut, to the matter at hand. Although you have cut into Aedirn, Saskia still has claims on this land, and no amount of oppression will weaken her support. With your forces injured, you could keep quiet and allow Saskia to keep her false titles as a show of goodwill toward the conquered, and perhaps make them believe your rule will be different than other nobles. Or you could just put your foot down and take everything. No one can stop you now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1100;The rebel whench will not be a ruler!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1100;She can keep the Lormark... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1101;A black day! Henselt wastes no time exploiting his victory, proclaiming his “rightful” rule over the land and forcing you into exile. He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know you could have destroyed him at anytime, but you relented for the sake of the people, afraid to destroy the image they held in their hearts. But this isn’t over. You will survive, beyond all this, and your ideals will never be quenched!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1101;Never!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1102;Henselt takes Vergen, but remains silent, even containing some of the purge carried out by his soldiers. In his weakened state, he still fears you, and wishes to calm the blood of those he has conquered. A prudent move, but one that leaves you with an opening to exploit. The moment Henselt makes a mistake, you can swoop in and strike the killing blow! Just be mindful of your remaining allies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1102;Hm...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1103;The Kaedweni bastards overpowered your defenses, and Upper Aedirn is flooded with troops. Though you have escaped with your life for the time being, the situation looks grim. No one knows the true scope of Henselt’s ambitions, and your vassals might take advantage of your apparent weakness. The only saving grace is that Saskia’s forces suffered even more than yours. Either way, you have a long road ahead of you on your path, and must act before the crown of Aedirn slips through your royal fingers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1103;Damn!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1104;If the peasants are to revolt, let them revolt! If Vergen is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed! But if King Henselt is to fall? One must simply laugh. You destroyed the Dragonslayer, and you welcome the ire of other pretenders. They will provide you with amusement as you tighten your grip around the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1104;Perfect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1105;Let it go. The people of Upper Aedirn are still too numerous to take lightly, and one day they will adjust to your rule. For now you shall treat them fairly, and let their built up rage towards the nobility slowly fade into nothing as life resumes. This is the only way to destroy the soul of Saskia. The Pontar shall be the rock of your empire after all, and everyone will benefit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1105;Perfect!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1110;A flea has bitten a lion, or more appropriately, a dragon has swallowed a Unicorn! You have no excuses. You and your men fought magnificently, standing with you to the very end, and they would have all died there too, if you had given the order. But, even surrender and shame do not match the finality of death. You will survive and move on, for you are still Kaedwen’s proud warrior king. The final negotiations will take time, but for now you return to your homeland to lick your wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1110;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1111;The armies of Kaedwen scatter, and Henselt find himself trapped within the walls of Vergen! You have done it Saskia, you have repelled the foreign invader and proved that the lowborn are a match for any king, even one who stood up to the empire of Nilfgaard! Your valor towers over that of your noble allies, and the people firmly believe you are the savior who will change the world. But what should be done? Should you establish a new equal state here in the Pontar Valley, or perhaps press your advantage now and claim all of Aedirn for the good of all...or is the time not yet right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1111;Peace can finally prevail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBaok.1111;Nothing is over yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCaok.1111;Upper Aedirn isn't truly free yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1115;One must not get ahead of themselves. Your soldiers are running on adrenaline now, truly exhausted, and you must not risk the wrath of Aedirn who has uncalled troops remaining, and eyes you with fear. You consolidate for now, and show respect to Stennis, politely reminding him he will have to respect the wishes of the people and give them aid. He scowls, but is open to negotiation. Peace will reign, at least for a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1115;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1116;Some say the gods gave the decree, that all this was inevitable from the moment Saskia took up her sword. The Pontar Valley is NOT enough. To prove to the world your righteous path, inspiring all the downtrodden, you must claim one of their precious kingdoms, an entire country where people shall not longer be judged by the fortune of their birth! Prince Stennis and his vassals are but ants before your just ambitions, and if they stand in your way, then they will be destroyed along with all of the corrupt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1116;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1117;Before one can challenge kingdoms, they must prove they are capable of rule. You aim to establish paradise in the Pontar, a place where peasants and nonhumans live together in harmony, just as they had fought side by side against Henselt and other oppressors. You will not deliver the first blow, but if any noble is foolish enough to challenge you after your resounding victory, then they will be crushed. Slowly but surely, a new world is about to be born.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1117;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1112;Somehow, someway, Aedirn endured the onslaught of Kaedwen, though for a time it seemed as if the battle would never end. You owe much of your victory and survival to Saskia, though you are loathe to praise a rebel you may one day be forced to fight. For now, however, no one wishes for further war. You must go and seek your crown, and discipline the vassals who denied you support. The path of Aedirn is yours to mold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1112;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1113;After a long and arduous struggle, Henselt retreats beyond the ford, returning to Kaedwen in shame. Stennis proved much more useful than you had imagined, and certainly earned the praise and prestige now showered by his vassals. You may have to rethink your opinion of him. If he can be persuaded to look out for the common people, then he will be a magnificent ally...and if not, a terrifying enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1113;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.1114;Henselt never could have imagined that the son of the corpulent King Demavend would prove such a demon on the battlefield. You scatter his forces, and prove yourself a match for Saskia, who is forced to respect both your skill and sacrifices, for she could not have defended the people of Upper Aedirn without you. Your vassals are both shocked and overjoyed at the defeat of Henselt, swearing eternal loyalty and all of those nonsensical platitudes. Either way, no one will oppose you in the near future, and even those who once were willing may have altered their plans. A fortuitous start to your reign. Long live King Stennis!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.1114;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCaok.2002;It seem like Demavend's assassination have made other kings more careful. It's hard to get close to any of them.\n\n L.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.2002;There will be other chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCaok.2003;Second assassination was successful, [From.GetTitledName] id dead. It should be enough to throw North in chaos.\n\n L.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAaok.2003;Everything went as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
