EVTDESCmonster.1;Merchants have been coming to you and complaining about drowners. The creatures have ruined good that were left outside by the piers, and not for the first time, the merchants ask you to deal with the problem or they will take their trade elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.1;A witcher will make short work of the critters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBmonster.1;I will hire for a witcher to deal with the monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hire_witcher;Hire a witcher;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmonster.1;My soldiers are good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
send_your_soldiers;Send your solders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmonster.1;I hold no responsibility for your goods, deal with the monsters yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.3;Honoured [Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI have taken care of the drowners as you requested.\n\nWitcher [FromFrom.GetFullName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.3;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.4;The merchants have been patiently waiting for your promised witcher, but there still hasn't been any sign of him and their loses accumulate. The merchants ask you to finally deal with the drowners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.4;A witcher will make short work of the critters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.4; I will send my soldiers this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmonster.4; Go plow yourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.5;The merchants are grateful to you - the soldiers you sent to deal with drowners were successful and their goods are safe, from drowners at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.5;Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.6;The merchants are complaining once more, the soldiers made even bigger mess than drowners, although the drowners have been disposed of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.6;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.10;Your courtiers are frightened as a ghost of your ancestors roam the halls during the night lamenting their hollow existences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.10;Superstitious nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.10;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] save us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.20;A troll has been sighted in [Root.GetName], a local noble insists on hunting it down, but peasants ask you to spare it arguing that trolls are peaceful creatures and it would bring benefit to area by keeping bridges and roads in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.20;The troll will stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.20;Free the terrorized people of [Root.GetName] and kill the degenerate troll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.30;The Wild Hunt has been sighted galloping through sky on their skeletal steed. The procession were accompanied by a storm and screaming winds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.30;A bad omen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.42;You have noticed that one of your vassals, [From.GetTitledName], have changed, [From.GetSheHe] is like totally different person. Maybe someone is impersonating [From.GetHerHim], but something like that is impossible, only dopplers could do such perfect job and they are just legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.42;I never trusted [From.GetHerHim] all along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
search_for_person_doppler_is_impersonating;Search for 'real' [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.42;[From.GetSheHe] have just become a better person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmonster.42;It does seem suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmonster.42;Something like that is impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.43;The spy you sent to search [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s mysterious change has returned with news. After questioning servants at castle he did managed to find that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] changed few months ago when [FromFrom.GetSheHe] went riding, but nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.43;It's not conclusive evidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.44;The spy you sent to search [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s mysterious change has returned with news. After questioning servants at castle he found that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] changed few months ago when [FromFrom.GetSheHe] went riding. He even managed to find out about man who looks just like [FromFrom.GetTitledName] held deep within prison.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.44;Capture the impostor at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
get_rid_of_doppler;Get rid of impostor and return the titles to their rightful owner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.45;The spy you sent to search [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s mysterious change has returned with news. After questioning servants at castle he found that [FromFrom.GetFirstName] changed few months ago when [FromFrom.GetSheHe] went riding. He even managed to find out a corpse that somewhat looks just like [FromFrom.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.45;Seem like real [FromFrom.GetTitledName] was killed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.46;A ragged beggar looking similar to [From.GetTitledName] is claiming to be real [From.GetFirstName], the current so-called [From.GetTitle] is impostor who attacked [From.GetHerHim] when [From.GetSheHe] enjoying a ride few months ago and left [From.GetHerHim] to wolves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.46;it does match the time when [From.GetTitledName] changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.46;Guards, throw the crazy beggar out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.50;Rumors abound that several demons or evil spirits of some sort have recently habituated themselves near my residence. I have seen the commoners living nearby start to hang garlic on their windows in order to protect themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.50;I should do the same to protect myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.50;Those gullible, superstitious fools...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.60;Lately, everyone has noticed a lovely young maiden who occasionally comes to attend same church I go to. But what strikes everybody as amazing is her voice - it is beautiful beyond imagination! Why she is here, and who she is, no one knows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.60;But she doesn't harm anyone, so we accept her presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmonster.61;I am fascinated by her...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.62;A Mysterious Disappearance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.62;Where has [From.GetTitledFirstName] gone? No one knows what happened to that youth.\n\nI was in fact the last person to see him. He was there, by the sea, singing beautifully with that mysterious maiden with the lovely voice. They began walking towards the waters, but at that point I figured they may have wanted some privacy, so I left them alone.\n\nMaybe they were lovers, and eloped somewhere?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.62;Who knows. But I have business to attend to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmonster.63;Everyone slowly forgets about [From.GetTitledFirstName]. For all we know, he is dead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.63;Siren?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.63;Early in the morning, though I'm feeling sleepy, I want to escape the confines of my residence and get some fresh air. I travel to the edge of the sea, to feel the fresh ocean breeze and see the pure waters.\n\nFor my amusement, I walk into the waves getting my feet wet (no matter, my servants will clean me afterwards), and hurl some stones into the ocean, as far as I can, to see how strong I am. I pause, however, as I hear a young woman's voice.\n\nI turn around, and to my shock, I see that very same maiden with the beautiful singing voice, the one I thought eloped away, sitting on one of the nearby rocks. But this time, there's something different about her. I glance down, and to my horror I realize she has no feet, but fish scales.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.63;"Stop that stone-throwing" the mermaid says, smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmonster.64;I'm too shocked to say anything, much less apologize.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.64;A Voice Like No Other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.64;The mermaid explains, "You must understand one of the windows to our house is down there, and your stones were causing quite a racket!"\n\n"I... I... I... apologize!" I stutter. "But you... but wait, I thought you and him... we all thought... something happened to both of you?"\n\nShe smiles and says in a sing-song voice, "Worry not about him, he is happy where he is. We are married, and in love now. But... I am rude, to be so brash in the presence of a [Root.GetTitle]. Shall I sing you a song?";;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.64;Very well...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1monster.65;I'm starting to feel... sleepy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.64;Yes, yes please!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmonster.66;I can sit here all day and listen to her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.65;Waking Up By The Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.65;My servants woke me. Apparently everyone had been searching for me, and I fell asleep on the beach. "Did you see her, that... that creature?" I asked my servants. They shook their heads, confused.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.65;Maybe I just fell asleep on the beach and had a strange dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.66;Under the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.66;The mermaid sings, smiling at me as she plays with her hair. She begins to move towards the sea - but how does she without legs? But does it matter? Her voice is lovely beyond reason.\n\nAnd I, too, begin to walk towards the sea. "Sire," she says, briefly interrupting our song, "I have a friend, maybe two or more, who would be delighted to meet you."\n\nShe then continues singing, but I know she expects an answer from me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.66;Yes, I will go into the sea with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mermaid_death;...and enjoy the sweetest music men's ears have every heard, for all eternity! (You die... or so the official records will say.);;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonster.66;No, I cannot, I have my duties to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP2monster.65;She nods, and continues singing. Now, however, I'm starting to feel very sleepy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLEmonster.67;The Mermaid of [Root.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonster.67;Many years ago, the local ruler of this province was said to have been lured to the sea by mermaids, where he now lives in paradise for all eternity. The mermaid, nevertheless, is said to be a benevolent one, that watches over the locals for the sake of this lord.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonster.67;Interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
