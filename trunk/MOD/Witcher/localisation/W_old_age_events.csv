EVTDESCold_age.1;You realize one day that you do not feel as vibrant or capable as you used to be. After all, you are elderly now, having lived many decades. People only live so long, and sooner or later, you, too, will die and join your forefathers in the afterlife. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.1;Age is nothing but a number.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCold_age.10;Some of my courtiers believe that due to my old age, I shouldn’t go hunting as much as I used to. Why do people keep insisting I restrain myself? I think I’m old and wise enough to make my own decisions, right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.10;I’ll be fine, fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBold_age.10;Perhaps I really should cut down on my hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCold_age.10;I'll just make sure I won’t exert myself as much while hunting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDold_age.10;Undoubtedly [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will ensure I will not be harmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCold_age.11;The young men and women these days bother me - they don’t seem to have the same respectable, moral behavior I had when I was growing up. They listen to unsavory music, sit and walk in promiscuous ways, talk with vulgar terms, ignore the wisdom of [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName]... what has this world come to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.11;I wasn’t an angel myself years ago. They’ll improve with time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBold_age.11;They don’t understand the hardships I had to go through!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCold_age.11;I pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will give them strength and wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDold_age.11;Silly kids. They’re hopeless, useless imbeciles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCold_age.12;Being so old, you know that your death is near - a matter of if, not when. Because of this, thoughts of the afterlife have preoccupied you for a while. What if you don’t end up with a good afterlife? A fearful possibility, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.12;Pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBold_age.12;It doesn’t matter either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCold_age.12;I’ve lived a good life - what’s there to fear?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCold_age.13;As you grow older and older, your body gets weaker and weaker. The last few weeks have been particularly rough on you. You figure that your workload is causing you a lot of unnecessary stress, exhausting you and draining what energy you have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.13;What? It’s’ nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBold_age.13;At this rate, I think I’ll get sick...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCold_age.13;I’ll just have to work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDold_age.13;I’ll try to get some help from others...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCold_age.14;It is difficult being so elderly in a time when it is considered lucky to live to even half my age. I recall when everyone of my generation began to die, years ago. At first I was afraid I would be next, but I was lucky. I lived, while my friends and family keep dying one by one. Such “luck,” however, has only left me lonely and depressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAold_age.14;Someday, I will join the rest in heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBold_age.14;Still, I try to enjoy life while I still can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCold_age.14;Now, I no longer fear death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
