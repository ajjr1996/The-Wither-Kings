#Events ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
customization.0.desc;This menu will allow you to change the name of various realms, such as the Byzantine Empire. Note that the last option is always the default.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.1.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Byzantine Empire is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Byzantine Empire” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Byzantine Empire (default)”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.2.desc;If you wish to see the earlier options, temporarily choose one of the following, then activate the “Choose Realm Names” decision again.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.desc;This event allows you to turn childbirth mortality on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that newborns and their mothers have a small chance of dying following childbirth - sometimes one or the other, rarely both. This is to make gameplay more exciting, unpredictable, and realistic.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3;Normally, in VIET, mothers and children can die in childbirth - turn this on or off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.a;Turn childbirth mortality off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.3.b;Turn childbirth mortality on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.desc;This event allows you to turn the old age modifier on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that older characters are less capable than their younger counterparts. This is to make older characters die off earlier, unlike in vanilla where they lived too long. This will NOT remove existing old age modifiers!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4;Normally, in VIET, old characters have an increasingly higher chance of suffering from the effects of old age - turn this on or off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.a;Turn Old Age off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.4.b;Turn Old Age on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.5.desc;This menu will allow you enable or disable VIET's various war and CB tweaks and changes to your liking. Note that other changes may still apply! You can always change these settings if you change your mind.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.6.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent Orthodox holy wars on Muslims, and whether for all Orthodoxy or only yourself. Other restrictions still apply. By default, Orthodox rulers can only declare holy war on pagans, as historically the Orthodox church didn’t have a tradition of holy war like Catholicism.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.7.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent Republics from declaring holy wars, and whether for all Republics or only yourself. Other restrictions still apply. By default, Republics cannot declare holy wars - Republics should be more interested than trade than religious war, and this is also to prevent Republic blobbing.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.desc;This event allows you to turn the young age modifier on or off. By default, it is enabled. This means that characters younger than 6-10 are weaker and more susceptible to illness. It works alongside childbirth mortality to make childhood more perilous. This will NOT remove existing young age modifiers!;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.a;Turn Young Age off;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.8.b;Turn Young Age on (default);;;;;;;;;;;
customization.9.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Kingdom of Spain (Empire of Hispania in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kingdom of Spain” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kingdom of Spain”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.10.desc;This menu will allow you to enable or disable new mechanics specific to cultures or religions. By default, all mechanics are enabled. If you want to disable something, it is best that you disable it at the very beginning of a campaign, rather than mid-game, as there may be unintended effects, though nothing gamebreaking.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.11.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable Turkish features. Turkish features include the Turkish Conquest CB, the formation of the Turkish Empire for Turks who have captured Constantinople, as well as the Turkish Practical Trade system for king or emperor-tier Turkish lords and their relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.12.desc;This menu will allow you to enable or disable certain sets of flavor events in VIET. By default, all of these events are enabled. If you disable them, they will not randomly occur. You can always turn them on and off without serious consequences.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.13.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable events with overly blatant Elder Scrolls references, such as the one about getting an injury from a flying projectile in a certain body part. It’s for those who don’t want overused memes in their CKII game and don’t like VIET’s usage of them. :(;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.14.desc;This event allows you enable/disable W. African features, including the Griot system, various decisions (like the Iron Woman and Griot performance decisions) and other miscellaneous W. African features. It will not disable (most) W. African flavor events.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.15.desc;If you wish to see the earlier options, temporarily choose one of the following, then activate the “Choose Realm Names” decision again.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.16.desc;This event allows you to allow or prevent non-Christian Republics from using coastal CBs. Other restrictions still apply. By default, non-Christian Republics cannot use these to prevent blobbing as they have other avenues for expansion (such as Muslim Invasion or Pagan Subjugation).;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.17.desc;This decision/event will allow you to choose what name the Kingdom of Britain (Empire of Britannia in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kingdom of Britain” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kingdom of Britain”.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.18.desc;This event allows you to enable/disable Finnish Pagan features, including various Finnish Pagan decisions, karsikko markings, and the Haltija system. Note that the Shaman system will still function for the Tengri Pagans unless you’ve disabled Tengri features as well.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.19.desc;Some more options for you. If you want to go back to the first menu, choose the “Never mind” option and then go back to these events via the decisions menu.;;;;;;;;;;;
customization.20.desc;This event will allow you to choose what name the Kalmar Union (Empire of Scandinavia in vanilla) is known by in the game. You can always change it to something else, or set it back to the default “Kalmar Union” if you change your mind. If you want to reset, select the last option, “Kalmar Union”.;;;;;;;;;;;
