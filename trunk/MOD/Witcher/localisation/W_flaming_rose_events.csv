EVTDESCflaming_rose.11;My liege, the Order of the Flaming Rose stand ready to serve you in defense of Eternal Fire! Pax Christi,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCflaming_rose.31;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the Order of the Flaming Rose in their struggle against monsters and other evils, even though this will forever disinherit him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAflaming_rose.31;Go with my blessing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBflaming_rose.31;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPflaming_rose.32;[This.GetTitledFirstName] becomes a member of the Order of the Flaming Rose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPflaming_rose.33;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is disappointed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCflaming_rose.43;Most righteous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Order needs more castles in order to train troops and generate a supporting income. It has come to my attention that there is a suitable location in your demesne - in [FromFrom.GetName] to be specific. I am willing to pay you 100 gold in exchange for the right to construct a fortress there.\nPax Christi,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAflaming_rose.43;A reasonable request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBflaming_rose.43;Absolutely not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCflaming_rose.44;The Order of the Flaming Rose have constructed a castle in [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAflaming_rose.44;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCflaming_rose.36;Your Highness, this extremely generous donation will not be forgotten. You have my friendship, as well as that of the Church. Rest assured that you will be rewarded in Heaven, if not on Earth!\nPax Christi,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCflaming_rose.51;Your majesty, this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The Order serves Eternal Fire, but, one has to wonder, do you?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\nGrand Master [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAflaming_rose.51;Good Riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
