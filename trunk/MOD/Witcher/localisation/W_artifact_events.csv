EVTDESCartifact.1001;[From.GetTitledName], a courtier of yours, is in possession of a Gwyhyr sword. Having decide that you are more worthy to own such a splendid sword [From.GetSheHe] offered to sell it to you for a small compensation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1001;Of course I will buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1001;I have no need for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1002;A travelling merchant presents himself to you, he offers you to buy many rare good among whom there is a Gwyhyr sword. The merchant is willing to sell the sword, although for a hefty sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1002;Of course I will buy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1002;Why would a simple merchant have such expensive sword, it seems suspicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1003;The Gwyhr sword you recently bought turned out to be fake. After one swing the sword broke apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1003;Damn, I have been cheated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1004;Somehow you have found a Gwyhyr sword in one of the unused rooms in your castle. Possibly a previous inhabitant owned it and lost it or just forgot about it. Anyhow now the sword is yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1004;A bit rusty but nothing a polishing can't fix.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1005; A travelling knight is passing through you lands and have stopped at your castle. As courtesy would have it you went to greet him and were surprised to saw a Gwyhyr sword at his side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCartifact.1010;I own a Purple Living Bone and a Conynhaela, these plants both have strong healing properties but together they compliment each other even more allowing to cure practically any injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1010;I will keep them together so they are at hand when I need them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1011;You have decide to use Purple Living Bone and a Conynhaela to cure yourself. The procedure isn't pleasant, first the Conynhaela penetrate the skin and grow roots in your body, after that the Purple Living Bone enters your body and reinforce and regenerate your bones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1011;My body aches a bit but I do feel better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1012;On a stroll through the thick forests of Brokilon you came upon a small patch of land with sun shining through the tops of trees. Such places are rare in Brokilon and very suitable for finding healing plants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1012;I will certainly find a rare herb here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1012;To take something on must give in return, yet I have nothing to give.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAartifact.1014;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1020;One day an amber necklace appeared in front of you. I took you a single glance to recognize it - you had seen it before. It was the Brinsingamen, the necklace [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] always wears in all the statues and images depicting her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1020;Have I been favoured by [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1021;Amongst [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] most prized possessions was Brinsingamen. But you cannot find it anywhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1021;It seems I'm not devoted enough to [FromFrom.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1022;The Brinsingamen you once had received from Freya herself has now disappeared. It's no big surprise considering you aren't follower of her any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1022;Have I made the right choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1030;A travelling merchant presents himself to you, he offers you to buy many rare good among whom there is a Zefhar bow. The merchant is willing to sell the sword, although for a hefty sum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAartifact.1031;Damn, I have been cheated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1032;The keeper of your forests insisted to meet you. When you gave him audience he explained that he had found a dead poacher ripped apart by monsters. Among the poacher possessions was Zephar bow, but it wasn't enough to save him from monsters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1032;Bring the bow to me immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1032;I don't want possessions of dead, bury the corpse together with bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1033;An old elf have came to meet you. He explained that he was a great hunter once but now he is old and tired. So he wishes to pass his most prized possession, Zefhar Bow, to someone youger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBartifact.1033;No, I cannot except such a gift.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCartifact.1033;Wouldn't you rather stay with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1040;Rumours have reached your ears about a beautiful sword somewhere in Korath desert. You could sponsor expedition to recover it, but preparations will be quite costly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTBartifact.1041;It's even better then I expected, this demands additional rewards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1042;Months have passed with no word about the expedition you sent to recover the sword from Korath desert. You can only presume the worst - they have perished somewhere in the desert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1042;What a waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1050;There have been rumours going around about a sword in stone suddenly appearing and disappearing. This matches one version of legend about Zatret Voruta and his sword Balmur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1050;It's just a legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1051;When you woke up there was uproar, a sword in stone had appeared in courtyard overnight. Everyone wanted to give a try to pull it out, but since you are [Root.GetTitle] it is only proper that you have the first try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1051;I'll try my best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
attempt_to_pull_balmur_out_of_stone;Attempt to pull the sword from stone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1051;I'm not worthy of such honour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1052;Putting all your strengths together you tried to pull the sword out. At first it didn't budge but putting all your strength in you managed to pull it out. When everyone was busy congratulating you the stone where it was had mysteriously disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1052;A sword worthy of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTAartifact.1053;If I couldn't do it of course others couldn't too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1054;Others weren't as humble as you and tried to pull the sword out from the stone but no one managed it. The next day the stone had mysteriously disappeared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1054;Well, maybe legends are true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1055;There have been rumours going around about a sword held by a shining hand appearing from a lake. This matches one version of legend about Zatret Voruta and his sword Balmur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1055;It's just a legend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1056;After a tiring day you spent the evening in the garden when rippling in lake drew your attention. A hand appeared from it holding a sword beckoning you to come closer and gave the sword to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1056;Well, maybe legends are true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1060;Some of your soldiers on patrol reports that they have found an old tomb with pieces of armour and they have brought them to you. After a closer examination you recognize the armour as one worn by a legendary witcher - Raven. The ancient armour was forged by gnomes and dwarves and finished by elves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1060;Find a blacksmith to repair it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
repair_ravens_armor;Have the blacksmith repair the Raven's armour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1060;What worth those scraps could have?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1061;The blacksmith you hired have finally repaired Raven's armour. It took him many tries, but the ancient armour is in as good condition as it was new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1061;Only the best armour for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1062;The blacksmith you hired to repair Raven's armour couldn't do it, he wasn't skilled enough. The armour somehow holds together and is pretty to look at, but you doubt it will do any good in real combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

When you asked how the fortune-teller knew that you would come she revealed that she owns a Nehalenias' Mirror and she can sell it to you if you wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAartifact.1070;If you really have a Nehalenias' Mirror of course I will buying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBartifact.1070;Seems a bit shady.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCartifact.1080;A guard informs you - there is an old shady man, who wishes to meet you. After deciding that it's most likely something important, he is brought to you.
