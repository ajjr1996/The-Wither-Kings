#Descriptions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hindu_DESC;Hinduism is the majority religion of the Indian subcontinent and includes a wide spectrum of laws and prescriptions of "daily morality" based on karma, dharma, and societal norms. In-game, Hinduism is the main religion of its distinct religious group, "Vedic.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lingayat_DESC;Lingayatism, also known as Veerashaivism, is a distinct Shaivite tradition in India, established in the 12th century by the philosopher, statesman and social reformer Basavanna. It makes several departures from mainstream Hinduism and propounds monotheism through worship centered on Lord Shiva in the form of linga or Ishtalinga. It also rejects the authority of the Vedas, the caste system, and some Hindu beliefs such as reincarnation and karma. In-game, it is a heresy of Hinduism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bhakti_DESC;The Bhakti movement is a Hindu religious movement in which the main spiritual practice is loving devotion towards Shiva or Vishnu. It was initially considered unorthodox, as it rebelled against caste distinctions and disregarded Brahmanic rituals, which according to Bhakti saints were not necessary for salvation. In the course of time, however, owing to its immense popularity among the masses (and even gaining royal patronage) it became 'orthodox' and continues to be one of the most important modes of religious expression in modern India. However, as the game takes place during the time in which Bhakti was considered unorthodox, it is thus a heresy of Hinduism in-game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manichaean_DESC;Manichaeism is a Gnostic religion founded by the alleged prophet Mani who was put to death by the Sassanid Shahanshah Bahram I in 277. His 'Religion of Light' incorporated elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism and Gnosticism. In the game, Manichaeism is regarded as a Zoroastrian heresy. It has no formal head and no special game mechanics.;Le manichéisme est une religion gnostique fondée par le présumé prophète Mani, mis à mort en 277 par le sassanide Shahanshah Bahram Ier. Sa 'religion de la Lumière' emprunte des éléments au christianisme, au zoroastrisme, au bouddhisme et au gnosticisme. Dans le jeu, le manichéisme est une hérésie du zoroastrisme. Il n'a pas de chef officiel ni de règle spéciale en jeu.;Manichaismus ist eine gnostische Religion, die von dem Propheten Mani gegründet wurde, der im Jahre 277 durch den Sassaniden Shahanshah Bahram I. mit dem Tode bestraft wurde. Seine 'Religion des Lichts' beinhaltete Elemente des Christentums, Buddhismus und Gnostizismus. Im Spiel wird Manichaismus als zoroastrische Häresie behandelt. Es hat kein offizielles Oberhaupt und keine speziellen Spielmechaniken.;;El Maniqueísmo es una religión Gnóstica fundada por el presunto profeta Mani que fue condenado a muerte por el Sasánida Bahram Shahanshah I en 277. Su Religión de la Luz” incorporaba elementos del Cristianismo, el Zoroastrismo, el Budismo y el Gnosticismo. En el juego, el Maniqueísmo es considerado como una herejía Zoroastra. No tiene jefe oficial ni mecánica de juego especial.;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanite_DESC;Zurvanism was a branch of Zoroastrianism that had the divinity Zurvan as its First Principle (primordial creator deity). In Zurvanism, Zurvan is the god of infinite time (and space) and is aka (“one", "alone”) deity of matter. Zurvan is the parent of the two opposites representing the good god Ahura Mazda and the evil Angra Mainyu, in contrast with mainstream Zoroastrianism which asserts these two do not have Zurvan as a parent. Zurvan is regarded as a neutral god; being without gender (neuter), passion, one for whom there is no distinction between good or evil. Zurvan is also the god of destiny, light and darkness. In-game, Zurvanism is treated as a heresy of Zoroastrianism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a Gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enosh, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. According to most scholars, Mandaeans migrated from the Southern Levant to Mesopotamia in the first centuries CE and are certainly of pre-Arab and pre-Islamic origin. They are Semites and speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. While the Mandaeans are not considered Christians, in-game, they are treated as a heresy of Nestorian Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdakite_DESC;Mazdak was a Zoroastrian priest who claimed to be a prophet of Ahura Mazda. He attempted to reform the religion with Gnostic elements, and advocated communal possessions and welfare programs. His teachings fell out of favor with the Shahanshah Kavadh I in 524, but pockets of there heresy survived in remote areas. This heresy has no formal head and no special game mechanics.;Mazdak est un prêtre zoroastrien qui se dit être prophète d'Ahura Mazda. Il a tenté de réformer la religion au moyens d'éléments gnostiques et a prôné la communauté des biens ainsi que des mesures sociales. Ses enseignements sont tombés en disgrâce à l'arrivée de Shahanshah Kavadh Ier en 524, mais cette hérésie a survécu dans des poches isolées. Cette hérésie n'a pas de chef officiel ni de règle spéciale en jeu.;Mazdak war ein zoroastrischer Priester, der behauptete, ein Prophet von Ahura Mazda zu sein. Er versuchte, die Religion mit gnostischen Elementen zu reformieren, und befürwortete Gemeinschaftsbesitz und Wohlfahrtsprogramme. Seine Lehren verloren die Gunst des Shahanshah Kavadh I. im Jahre 524, doch in entfernten Gegenden überlebte diese Häresie. Diese Häresie besitzt kein offizielles Oberhaupt und keine gesonderten Spielmechaniken.;;Mazdak era un sacerdote Zoroastra que decía ser un profeta de Ahura Mazda. Intentó reformar la religión con elementos Gnósticos, y abogó por las posesiones comunales y programas de bienestar. Sus enseñanzas cayeron en desgracia con el Shahanshah Kavadh I en 524, pero detalles de su herejía sobrevivieron en zonas remotas. Esta herejía no tiene jefe oficial ni mecánica de juego especial.;;;;;;;;;x
qadiri_DESC;The Qadiri are a Sufi order founded by Abdul-Qadir Gilani in the 12th century. The order relies strongly upon adherence to the fundamentals of Islam. They are a heresy of Sunni Islam in-game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
alawite_DESC;The Alawites are a prominent mystical religious group centred in Syria who follow a branch of the Twelver school of Shia Islam. Alawites revere Ali ibn Abi Talib, and the name means followers of Ali. The sect is believed to have been founded by Ibn Nusayr in the eighth century. The Alawi sect is a heresy of Shia Islam in-game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
samaritan_DESC;The Samaritans are an ethnoreligious group of the Levant, descended from ancient Semitic inhabitants of the region. Religiously the Samaritans are adherents of Samaritanism, an Abrahamic religion closely related to Judaism. Based on the Samaritan Torah, Samaritans assert their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the Babylonian Exile, preserved by those who remained in the Land of Israel, as opposed to Judaism, which they assert is a related but altered and amended religion. In-game, they are a heresy of the Jewish faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maronite_DESC;The Maronites are an ethnoreligious group in the Levant. They derive their name from the Syriac saint Maron whose followers moved to Mount Lebanon from northern Syria establishing the nucleus of the Maronite Church. They are a heresy of Nestorianism in-game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
chaldean_DESC;The Chaldeans are ethnic Assyrian adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church (originally called The Church of Assyria and Mosul), that part of the Assyrian Church of the East which entered communion with the Catholic Church in the 17th century. They are considered a Nestorian heresy in the game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paulician_DESC;The Paulicians were a Christian Adoptionist sect, also accused by medieval sources of being Gnostic and quasi Manichaean Christian. They flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and the Eastern Themes of the Byzantine Empire. In all probability, the Paulician movement and its metaphysical philosophy or ideology was brought about by a distinctive synthesis of several similar and variable strains. Overall, it can be broadly stated that populist, late-Marcionism fused to a type of idiosyncratic Manichæism of similarly popularized form, appear to be the two main constituents of Paulician spiritual doctrine. In the game, Paulicianism is treated as a heresy of Orthodox Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bosnian_DESC;The Bosnian Church is thought to be an indigenous branch of the Bogomils that existed in Bosnia during the Middle Ages. The church's organization and beliefs are poorly understood, because few if any records were left by church members, and the church is mostly known from the writings of outside sources, primarily Roman Catholic ones. In the game, the Bosnian Church serves as one of the heresies of Orthodox Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
syriac_DESC;Syriac Christianity comprises multiple Christian traditions of Eastern Christianity with a history going back to the 1st century AD. In-game, the Syriac heresy of Miaphysite Christianty specifically represents the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch, the autocephalous Oriental Orthodox church based in the Eastern Mediterranean. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewish_DESC;Judaism is a monotheistic religion, with its main inspiration being based on or found in the Hebrew Bible (also known as the Tanakh) which has been explored in later texts, such as the Talmud. It is not a homogenous religion, and embraces a number of streams and views. Like today, during the medieval period, Rabbinic Judaism was the most numerous stream, and holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. As such, the Jewish religion in-game represents the Rabbinic brand of Judaism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
karaite_DESC;Karaite Judaism is a Jewish movement characterized by the recognition of the Tanakh alone as its supreme legal authority in Halakha (Jewish religious law) and theology. It is distinct from mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral Torah, the legal decisions of the Sanhedrin as codified in the Talmud, and subsequent works to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah, without additional Oral Law or explanation. As a result, Karaite Jews do not accept as binding the written collections of the oral tradition in the Mishnah or Talmud. In-game, Karaite Judaism is a heresy of mainstream Judaism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
buddhist_DESC;Buddhism is a religion indigenous to the Indian subcontinent that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and practices largely based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the Buddha, meaning "the awakened one". He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering (dukkha) through the elimination of ignorance (avidya) by way of understanding and the seeing of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada) and the elimination of craving (tanha), and thus the attainment of the cessation of all suffering, known as the sublime state of nirvana. There are two major branches of Buddhism - Therevada, which is dominant in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, and Mahayana, which comprises of several sects such as Zen, Pure Land, and Tibetan Buddhism, and is widespread in East and Central Asia. The Buddhism represented in-game is mainly Mahayana Buddhism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bon_DESC;Bon is religious tradition of Tibet tenuously linked with Tibetan Buddhism, though scholars disagree as to the exact relation between the two. Some argue it is an entirely distinct, pre-Buddhist religious tradition, while others see it as a syncretic belief system combining elements of both Buddhism and pre-Buddhist Shamanism and Animism. Regardless, Bon is treated as a heresy of Buddhism in-game.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maitreyaism_DESC;Maitreya is said to be the future Buddha of this world in Buddhist eschatology. Historically, and particularly during the medieval era, various Maitreyan sects were rampant throughout East Asia, particularly China during times of turmoil. These sects developed unorthodox beliefs (influenced by other Asian religions such as Taoism and possibly even foreign ones such as Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism) in order to support their often anti-establishment views. In the game, they are all under the umbrella term of Maitreyism and are considered a heresy of Buddhism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
carvaka_DESC;Carvaka is a system of Indian philosophy that assumes various forms of materialism, philosophical skepticism and religious indifference. It is classified as a heterodox Hindu school of thought, and is today not considered to be part of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy. It emerged as an alternative to the orthodox Hindu schools in antiquity, and survived into the medieval era up to the 12th century AD after which this system seems to have disappeared without leaving any trace. The reason for this sudden disappearance is not known.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
sammitiya_DESC;The Sammitiya sect was one of the eighteen or twenty early Buddhist schools in India, an offshoot of the Vatsiputriya sect. Like its predecessor, it claims the person (Sanskrit: pudgala) as a carrier of skandhas endures, and as such was a representative (perhaps the most prominent one) of the Pudgalavada schools. The sect was considered heretical by Mahayana Buddhists. Regardless, it seems to have been particularly strong in the Sindh. The end of the Sa?mitiya sect appears to coincide with the overall decline of Buddhism in India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
