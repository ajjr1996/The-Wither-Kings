EVTDESCsorcery.0;I have decided to embark on the dangerous quest of becoming a sorcerer. The mission will be dangerous and require all my abilities and resources to succeed. In any case I must prevail. Somewhere in the vast libraries of the world lies the secret of magical power and it is only a matter of time before I will find it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.0;Send your emissaries to buy any book on sorcery they can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.0;The time is not right, I'll try next year;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.1;The only thing these books gave me was a headache, and I am no closer to finding the secret of magic. I could use the help of a court magician, but on the other hand I can try to find it on my own..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.1;There is no book here that can help in my quest, I need to buy more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.1;I should ask my court magician for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.1;The information must be somewhere in here, I just need to study harder;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.2;Not caring much about the financial cost I need to decide how wide of a net I want to cast. Surely the more books I buy the greater my chance of finding the right one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.2;I need just a few more books;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.2;A lot will be needed to find what I'm looking for;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.2;I will buy all the books I can find!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsorcery.2;I can't aford any such expenses this year;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.3;I have lavishly overspent on books and yet I am no closer to finding what I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.3;It was such a foolish move;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.4;Through my efforts and heavy purse I managed to find the information I was looking for. It seems I won't need anyone else's help after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.4;I've learned a bit about sorcery;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.5;Mage replies to request for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.5;Calcu-calcu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.6;Most Gracious Liege\n I am honored and privileged to receive your request for help and will happily oblige.\n [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.6;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.7;Most illustrious master\n I am honored with your request for help, yet I cannot oblige for I do not think we know each other well enough for me to share magical knowledge with your.\n [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.7;What a pompous bastard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.8;Studying with court mage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.8;calc-calc;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.9;I've spent countless sleepless nights with my court magician and I think it started to pay off. Last night [From.GetBestName] has praised my progress so far and the speed with which I am grasping the magical arcana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.9;I feel I've learned something valuable today;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.10;All these sleepless nights with my court magician are for nothing. [From.GetBestName] dared to scold me for incompetence and childish grasp of the magical arcana.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.10;Storm out of the room;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.10;Punch [From.GetBestName] in the face;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.11;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], I would never trouble you with such minor details, but taking into account your quest I believe a small dotation to upgrade my laboratory would provide most beneficial to our enterprise./n [From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.11;Very well, if that will help my progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.11;I won't be manipulated like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.12;The magician wasn't too happy with my blunt reply and quickly found many excuses to not see me again. Like a sneaky fox hid behind the magically guarded doors of the laboratory to never be seen again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.12;I am again on my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.13;While on a break from my studies I wandered into the nearby forest to clear my mind. To my great suprise I spoted an unusual sight. A bunch of cats grouped themselves around a mysterious rock. I have read that cats are able to sense magic, among others the powerful intersections where the powers of chaos cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.13;I should investigate this further;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.14;The intersections are places of power which can be used to perform magical rituals of great potency. I should gather some men and venture personally to Nilfgaard's Academy located in its capital, as well as to school libraries of Ban Ard or Thanned to seek answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.14;Time to put my armor and venture on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.15;I have arrived at the academy of Ban Ard, but its gates are shut to those who possess no magical abilities. I need to think of a way to get inside their main library and find the book I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.15;I shall rely on my skill of intrigue and think of a clever plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.15;I will rely on my skill of diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.15;My abilities of intrigue and diplomacy are inadequate to find a way inside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.18;I have arrived at the academy of Thanned, but its gates are shut to those who possess no magical abilities. I need to think of a way inside their main library to find the book I need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.16;I always felt that planning was my strongest suit, but how much planning is enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.16;A simple plan will be enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.16;I need a solid plan if I want to get inside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.16;It wouldn't hurt spending a few months on figuring out a master plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.161;While everyone was asleep I sneaked into the library using a half-open window on the main floor. The guards were not aware of my presence and without much effort I located the book I needed and left unseen by anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.161;Like stealing candy from a baby;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.160;When everyone was asleep I sneaked into the library using a half-open window on the main floor. Unfortunately moments after finding the book I was spotted with it by one of the guards. Trying to escape his barrage of magic missles I had to make a jump through a glass window down into a nearby pond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.160;The water was cold and shallow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.17;I always felt that diplomacy was my strongers ability, now I need to utilize it well by figuring out what to do next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.17;A few kind words can get me anywhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.17;A good disguise should do the trick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.17;You can achieve more with gold and a kind word, than with words alone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.171;I had no problem gaining access to the library by pretending to be a well known university professor. Thinking that I am one of the researchers from Oxenfurt the librarian was more than happy to show me where to find the book I needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.171;I am a true master of smoothtalk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.170;I had no problem gaining access to the library by making everyone believe that I am a well known professor. Or so I thought. Soon after finding the book I was after the librarian pointed me out to a group of guards. Without thinking much I took a jump through a glass window straight into a nearby pond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.170;The water was cold and shallow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.99;I do not have the necessary skills to proceed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.99;I see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.19;I have arived at the city of the golden towers. Its borders stretch from the banks of river alba up to the horizon. It is a sight of splendour that I cannot take long to admire as I need to find a way into the well guarded University Library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.19;Nothing opens more doors than a good bribe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.19;Although I'm not a citizen I could try convincing the guards to let me in;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.19;Stand aside plebeians I am an imperial citizen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.20;The Imperial Library was bigger than I could foresee, and it took me just minutes to lose my way in the labyrinth of bookshelves. When taking yet another turn I have found myself standing right in front of a section dedicated to the life of see otters and at that point I lost all hope of finding the book I was looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.20;I think I should risk it and try to find the right section on my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.20;There is no shame in asking someone for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.20;I am not a fool, let me think. There must be a logical way around this place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.200;Agh, another wrong turn. No matter how much I try I keep on getting lost in this damn place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.200;All I can do now is keep trying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.201;Finally! I knew that my effort will not go unrewarded. After few hours of search I found the book I was looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.201;A night of reading awaits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.21;Do I like you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.21;Yes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.21;No;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.210;While wandering around the library I met [From.GetBestName] who kindly walked me to the desired section of the library. Unfortunately to my annoyance he would not quit talking about the greatness of the empire and the barbaric ways of the filthy northerners. By the end I was so sick of it that I stopped him and proudly shouted to his face... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.210;I am a northerner!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.211;While wandering around the library I met [From.GetBestName]who kindly walked me to the section of the library I was looking for. We were talking all the way there and I was positively suprised with how nice the people in Nilfgaard can be. It's good to meet once in a while a person so fascinating like [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.211;Such a nice person;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.22;I've waited for the cover of darkness to sneak the magic book out of the library. When walking down the winding alleyways I've noticed someone following me. Not sure of his intentions I decided to act rather be taken by surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.22;Confront the man and ask him what he wants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.22;Don't risk it and run away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.221;I decided to run. Choosing the most crooked alleys and darkest corners, taking many turns and twists I managed to lose the assailant and get him off my track.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.221;I successfully got away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.220;I chose the most crooked alleys and darkest corners, taking many turns and twists trying to lose the man, but it was to no avail. I got myself so confused that in the end I walked right into him and he wasn't too happy with my puny attempt at getting away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.220;What do you want from me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.23;After a night in a nearby tavern the robber was now just a distant memory. I have packed my belongings and asked the squires to prepare my horse. In a matter of minutes my retinue was packed and ready. I was glad the journey was nearly over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.23;It is time to go home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.24;After many days of journey I have finally arrived home. The servants greeted me warmly, and there was plenty of food and celebration during the first few days. Even though I enjoyed it very much I did not become complacent and remembered the greater purpose at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.24;There are many months of difficult study ahead of me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.25;After many months and countless hours of study I have finally found a way to gain magical abilities. I can use the power of the intersection to perform a ritual of transfer. To make it happen I will require a willing or an unwilling participant whose powers can be taken from them and transfered onto myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.25;I should befrend a mage at my court and ask him to hand me his powers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.25;There is no time to waste I will sacrifice a gifted child to acomplish the task;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.250;I decided to convince a willing sorcerer to transfer his powers to me. This may prove difficult and the suitable mage will definately require a compensation for his sacrifice, but I am certain this is the right way to do this. All i need to do now is have a friendly sorcerer in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.250;This is the right way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.251;I haven't got this far to waste time on making friends. I will send my scouts in search of a suitable child and plot to kidnap it when the time is right. No one should miss a magical lowborn once I sacrifice it for my own cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.251;The act of creation requires sacrifice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.26;Mage spoken to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.26;Mage sends message;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.27;I have spoken with [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetSheHe] agreed to my proposal under the condition that I will grant [From.GetHerHim] land to rule as [From.GetHerHis] own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.27;I will give you the land;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.27;I have no land to give, but will compensate that with money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.27;I need to think this through;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsorcery.27;I will give neither. Guards hold [From.GetHerHim] down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.270;I have spoken with [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetSheHe] refused outright saying that I have neither enough land nor money to give to compensate [From.GetHerHim] for the potential loss of magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.270;We will look into this in a years time, I may have something then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.28;The sorcerer accepted my offer and woved to speak further on this matter in a months time, after dealing with few loose ends that needed sorting out while [From.GetSheHe] still had [From.GetHersHis] powers at hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.28;I understand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.29;Event Ping for ID30;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.29;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.30;The sorcerer returned just as promised but instead of willingly participating in the ritual [From.GetHeShe] had the nerve to ask for a substantial amount of money to cover some unexplainable expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.30;Very well, as long as these are the last expenses I have to cover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.30;How dare you! Few weeks in the dungeon will change your mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.31;I will not talk says mage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.31;Not talk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.32;My dungeons seemed to have little effect on [From.GetFirstName] for after all the horrors I subjected [From.GetHerHim] to [From.GetSheHe] was still not willing to cooperate at all. This is of no consequence. I will find a way to convince [From.GetHerHim] to take part in the ritual whether [From.GetSheHe] wants it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.32;Another month in the prison should change your mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.32;I will whipp the consent out of you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.32;Off with your hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsorcery.32;You wont need your eyes for the ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.33;Mage decides whether to agree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.33;Wound check and response;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.340;Traitor and rebel [From.GetSheHe] is. After spending months in my dungeon [From.GetSheHe] still dared to refuse my request. I will mend your crooked ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.340;Off to the torture chamber with you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.341;After months of unsavory persuasion [From.GetFirstName] agreed that I was in my right as [From.GetHerHis] liege and master to ask [From.GetHerHim] to participate willingly in the ritual I devised. Begging for mercy [From.GetSheHe] admitted [From.GetHerHis] wrongdoings and agreed to transfer [From.GetHerHis] power to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.341;I will prepare the ritual at once, and some crossbowmen just in case;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.35;The candles were burning brightly when the sorcerer stepped in the middle of the magical circle drawn at the intersection. [From.GetSheHe] began to concentrate and harnessed the power of the magical crossing to separate [From.GetHerHis] magical abilities from [From.GetHerHis] physical body transfering them onto me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.35;I humbly accept this gift;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.36;Child is born;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.36;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.37;After days of searching my scouts have finally found a lowborn child born with magical powers. All I need to do now is initiate a plot against it and gather enough supporters to drag it back to my court in chains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.37;I should start plotting as soon as I'm ready;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.38;Its been years since any real progress and I am not gettin any younger. I need to start considering other options or double my efforts to achieve my goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.38;I should find another way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.38;I need a bit more time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.39;There may be another way to evoke the powers of sorcery in a mere mortal. A gift of precious blood could pay the price, but such blood could only come from a close relative like my child. I should think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.39;Whatever it takes, I am ready to make the sacrifice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.39;This is madness, I simply need a bit more time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcery.39;But I have no children;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.391;It is never an easy thing for a parent to lose their child, but in this instance the death was worth it. I may be hated by others but I am proud of myself that I have acomplished the task. I hold the gift of magical powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.391;The deed is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.40;I have gathered enough supporters and the time is right. I will send a band of thugs to kidnap the child when it is most vulnerable. I'm sure my supporters will point out to possible openings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.40;Set the plan in motion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcery.40;This is too cruel, I cannot kidnap a child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.41;I am kidnapped;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.41;Sad sad child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.42;The hired thugs succeeded at kidnapping the child and brought it crying and in chains before my throne. I should feel bad, but somehow this sight pleases me most.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.42;I should prepare the ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.43;I am being sacrificed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.43;bye bye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcery.44;I held the dagger firmly in my hand while the child was struggling to release itself from my choking grasp. But by the end, when the blade struck its heart, it could do nothing more than release a silent cry of misery. The magical crossing worked as intended, transfering the power of the child onto myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcery.44;It was a cruel but necessary deed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.1;Fighter ping event;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.1;Start Battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.100;Round Fight Two;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.100;Start Battle Engine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.2;The hooded individual stood there for a moment smiling at me, and without much explanation he drew his sword and demanded to give him all my money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.2;Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcbattle.2;Attack him with your sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcbattle.2;Try to knock him out and escape;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsorcbattle.2;Beg him not to take all your money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.3;The hooded bandit was fast, but still slow enough for me to parry his attack and counter it before he could guard. My aim was true and blade sharp. Before he could do anything his cold body was lying by my feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.3;Mors tua, vita mea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.4;The hooded bandit was quicker than me and before I could strike or defend myself his blade struck me drawing blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.4;I am too wounded to fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcbattle.4;I've been maimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcbattle.4;Tis only a flesh wound;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.6;I tried to run as fast as I could, but the bandit was somehow faster than me and before I knew it he struck me with his sword right on the back halting my escape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.6;I cannot fight any more, the battle is lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcbattle.6;His strike maimed me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcbattle.6;I have been wounded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.7;Exchanging a few more blows we stood back where we started and I had to quickly make a decision what to do to survive this encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.7;I surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcbattle.7;You shall taste my steel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCsorcbattle.7;Make a run for it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDsorcbattle.7;Beg for mercy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.700;After pleading my case I was surprise to see the attacker understanding my reasoning and offering me a better deal of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.700;I gladly accept your terms, I surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBsorcbattle.700;I changed my mind, fight me scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.800;The robber was hardly impressed with my fake tears and pleas and demanded that I fight or unconditionally surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.800;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCsorcbattle.8;I tried my best, but that wasn't enough, after a difficult battle I was wounded too bad to fight. Seeing continuous drops of blood escaping my body I began to lose consciousness and fell down losing the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAsorcbattle.8;Even the mightiest falls;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
