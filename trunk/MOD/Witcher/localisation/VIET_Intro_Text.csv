#Intro text for four main modules;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.1.name;VIET Core;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.1.desc;Thanks  for using VIET! This event will set up and introduce VIET Core.\nCore contains the most minimal changes out of all of VIET’s modules, focusing on simple balance and flavor tweaks that don’t really change basic vanilla gameplay. It includes changes to CBs, tweaks traits to balance their effects and make them more important to gameplay, adds localized titles for several cultures, and has other minor balance and flavor tweaks. \nIf you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread. You can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.\nEnjoy, and have fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.1.a;Ok.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.2.name;VIET Events;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.2.desc;Thanks for using VIET! This event will set up and introduce VIET Events.\nEvents includes plenty of new flavor events that can pop up during the game, similar to many of the generic events in vanilla CKII. They are meant to provide more variety and flavor to the game. Note that a few events won’t fire unless you have Immersion, but Immersion is not required.\nIf you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread. You can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.\nEnjoy, and have fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.2.a;Alright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.3.name;VIET Traits;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.3.desc;Thanks for using VIET! This event will set up and introduce VIET Traits.\nTraits has two main components. Firstly, it tweaks traits to balance their effects and make them more important to gameplay (something included in the Core module as well). Secondly, it adds several new congenital traits so there’s more of a balance between positive and negative traits as well as more variety.\nIf you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread. You can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.\nEnjoy, and have fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.3.a;I've heard others say the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.4.name;VIET Immersion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.4.desc;Thanks for using VIET! This event will set up and introduce VIET Immersion.\nImmersion is the largest out of all of VIET’s modules. It includes several new features and improves balance even more so than the Core module. However, like the rest of VIET, it is designed to be as unintrusive as possible and blend seamlessly with vanilla gameplay. Immersion also includes plenty of customization options. Some are included with instructions in the download, while others can be accessed through the decisions menu.\nIf you have any problems, don't hesitate to post in the VIET thread. You can also take a look at the thread for more detailed information.\nEnjoy, and have fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.4.a;Baklava!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.8.desc;Thanks for using VIET! If you see this event, this means VIET Assets has successfully installed. VIET Assets is the only required module of VIET - it includes most of VIET’s localization as well as its art.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.8.name;VIET Assets;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.8.a;Okay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.7.desc;Hi! This is cybrxkhan. Before you start playing, I need to say a few things. This message will only pop up once in the game.\nFirstly, have you looked at the readme at least once, even if for the installation instructions? If you’ve never done so, please do so - I’d really appreciate it! Secondly, if your game has problems, please look in the troubleshooting section of the first page for common problems and their solutions (it’s the third post, and there’s a link to it in the “links” section of the first post). Lastly, don’t hesitate to ask questions or report possible bugs or issues - I’m more than happy to help.\nI apologize if any of this is obnoxious or annoying, but I just want to make sure we iron out any potential sources of issues beforehand for both of our sakes. :);;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.7.name;Before you continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.7.a;Okay. I promise I read all this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.7.b;I’m a VIET veteran, I know this mod better than you do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cybrxkhan.7.c;Sorry, didn’t bother to read, too eager to play! [You’ll regret this! >:(];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
