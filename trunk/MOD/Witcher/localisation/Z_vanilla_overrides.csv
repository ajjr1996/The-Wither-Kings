EVTDESC100180;It's hard being a good [Root.Religion.GetName] these days, but my friend truly shocked me when I realized we did not share the same religion. My dear friend is a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

After a long, heated discussion about religion, considered disadvantages and advantages of our respective religions I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA100182;A friend like you is hard to find, [From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC100184;It went exactly as I had feared - [From.GetTitledFirstName] couldn't accept me being a [Root.Religion.GetName] and condemned me and my religion.
