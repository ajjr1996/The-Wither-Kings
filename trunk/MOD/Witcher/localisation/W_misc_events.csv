EVTDESCmisc.1;Tonight the night sky is clear, and you can see every single star shining in the sky like jewels on a fine, black dress. What wonder can be found in heaven’s creation! What magic! You have a rare moment of peace in yourself as you admire the night sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.1;Amazing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.2;A butterfly landed on my arm. It looks so harmless, just fluttering its wings, unaware of my existence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.2;I’ll wait until it flies away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.2;Shake it off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.2;Smash and kill it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.3;I can’t fall asleep quickly at night. I just can’t. There’s so many distracting noises - night guards walking around, animals outside making noises, the things I think inside my head... When will it stop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.3;Gargh! I’ll try closing my eyes again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.3;I think I’ve just figured out a way to make an earplug...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.4;Lately, in the morning, you’ve snuck out of your residence with a few trusted bodyguards, to walk the beaches and smell the fresh ocean breeze at dawn. There is something amazing when you heard the waves crashing on the sand, the sound of pure, raw, natural energy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.4;But now I better get back home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.5;Hammers, anvils, wood, footsteps, bleating, beating, shouting, ships, waves, stones, coins, grabbing, crashing, smashing, ropes boxes, barrels... there’s so many sounds and sights around the docks. “How do we do it?” one of the workmen say, when you ask them. “We just got used to it.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.5;The things you fellows go through every day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.5;There’s a reason why inferiors work here, unlike me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.6;The distant memory of kissing your first love for the first time has been haunting you these past few days. Unfortunately, your love was a mere commoner, a peasant’s child who used to live near your castle when you were younger. Eventually, as you recall sadly, you two had to part, when…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.6;Your guardian discovered the affair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.6;You had to separate, out of a sense of duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.6;Your love died in an unfortunate accident.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPAmisc.6;What could you do? Your guardian was right - there was, and is, no way a noble and a peasant could marry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPBmisc.6;It was painful telling your lover the news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPCmisc.6;If only you weren’t distracted by other business that day, you could have saved your lover!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.7;It was sad knowing you would never see your first love again. Though young, this event taught you a very valuable lesson, that…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.7;Everyone has a place in society, including myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.7;Life is terrible, and no one is ever happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.7;No matter what, I will see my love again in heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.7;True love is stupid idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.8;You got lost while hunting in your territory. As you find your way back, you by chance come to a small but hazardous river. You suddenly remember how you were once here, as a young man, hunting with your friends. One of them nearly died tripping on a slippery rock. At the time you thought it hilarious, seeing your friend slip like that. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.8;Now I see we were foolish to ignore the dangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.9;“You! I know you! We were still youths when we last met!” exclaims the merchant you accidentally bumped into. It takes a few seconds for you to recognize one of your childhood friends. It isn’t long before you two go to the tavern to catch up. As you two reminiscence about your younger days...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPmisc.9;The two of you engage in good conversation. It is always good to see an old friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.9;You ask him about that girl he once loved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmisc.9;You talk about when the two of you were apprentice merchants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmisc.9;You discuss the hardships of life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDmisc.9;You share your adventures as traders traveling the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmisc.10;Evening with an Old Friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.10;“Haha, I’m glad that ended well, though,” your friend says. You learn that while he is not too wealthy, he has engaged in some rather cunning and profitable schemes as a traveling merchant. For instance, there was one time he and one of his associates managed to purposely crash the market price of pyrite in one city as part of their business scheme.\nCertainly, he has learned  a lot traveling around. After a while, you ask him, “Why don’t you work for my family’s business? I know you’re capable, and we can provide you the financial protection and assets you need.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.10;“I need to think about it, but it’s a hard offer to refuse!” he replies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAMEmisc.11;Evening with an Old Friend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmisc.11;“Haha, too bad it didn’t end as well as I hoped,” your friend says. The two of you continue chatting for some time, but eventually you part ways, for tomorrow your friend will travel to a far-away city to engage in some venture. Before leaving, however, your friend offers you some useful advice on the constantly changing prices of various goods your family tends to trade in. “In the Far East, the price for several commodities are dropping really fast, and I think it will affect several key markets,” he tells you, before explaining why. As you listen intently, he continues, “In order to profit from that, I suggest that you…”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmisc.11;I did not expect that! I must act fast to profit from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
