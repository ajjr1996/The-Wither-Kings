EVTDESCreligious.10;I sit in the local Church during the Bishop’s sermon, tired and weary. Why is the world such a cruel, terrible place? The voice of the preaching Bishop fades away, as I begin to focus elsewhere. I begin to pray to God, to pray for forgiveness of my sins, to pray that I may enjoy life once more.;;;;;;;;;;;x
