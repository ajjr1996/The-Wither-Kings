EVTDESCjob.100;Not unlike every other morning, a bunch of noble and peasant petitioners assembled in the great hall with various demands and requests. It is your job as a Chancellor to hear them out and decide the eventual compensations for the wrongs they might have suffered, even if not all of their claims will turn out to be justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.100;I will hear them all out and compensate them justly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.100;Only those of noble birth deserve to be heard or compensated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.100;Only those with proper forms and documents will be heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDjob.100;[Root.GetRandomGodName] will compensate you in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.101;During the last feast organized by your liege a rather serious diplomatic incident occurred when a foreign dignitary wasn't assigned a seat and had to sit beside some unimportant peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.101;We should make an official apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.101;But those ribs were so tasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.101;Why do I always have to talk us out of everything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.102;A foreign envoy just arrived at court immediatly asking for an official meeting with the Chancellor. The guards are ready and waiting for your eventual orders on what to do with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.102;Our kindness is golden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.102;He will get an audiance, nothing more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.102;We don't need filthy foreigners wandering around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.103;Dreadful news just came to your attention. A close family member of your liege was seen coming out of a brothel in [Root.Capital.GetName] more than once recently arising doubts in the local populace. Some going as far as claiming that even the liege [Root.Liege.GetHerHim]self has [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] head more focused on whores than on the well-being of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.103;Silence is golden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.103;Publicly deny everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.103;Only the [Root.GetRandomGodName] can save his sinner soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.104;A foreign diplomat just arrived at court bringing along with him many gifts from his lord. While meeting with him he was kind enough to hint that if you made sure the gifts were accepted a deal was going to be struck. As a consequence of it you would have your fair share of wealth as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.104;I see what you're saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.104;My [Root.Liege.GetTitle] will be very happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.104;[Root.GetRandomGodName] forbids! I will not deal with infidels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.105;During the last feast organized by your liege a rather serious diplomatic incident occurred when a drunken foreign envoy called my liege's mother a cunt and suggested that what came out of her would surely be even worse than that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.105;Off with his head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.105;We demand compensations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.105;[Root.GetRandomGodName] will forgive his carelessness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.110;A prominent philosopher recently came out with a book that could undermine the peasants' beliefs in [Root.GetRandomGodName] and the strength of the realm with it. You cannot afford being idle with those dire words flowing around the mouths of the peasants.  A course of action has to be decided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.110;There is wisdom in his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.110;A bit of reinterpretation here and there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.110;To the stake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.111;Horrible news have reached your ears: the peasants in [Root.Capital.GetName] are increasingly talking about how the church is only lustful and sinful. You have to be careful on what to do on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.111;There is truth in those words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.111;Their fervor can be used to our cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.111;Their burning will make a fine show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.112;A whole lot of angered peasants showed up at your doorstep with a fair looking wench who they claim is no less than a witch. 'Her blue eyes have something evil about them', the leader of the mob says, and when he asked her what she was doing with all those herbs she picked up in the fields she wasn't able to give him an acceptable answer, hence she must be a witch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.112;The lash will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.112;[Root.GetRandomGodName] is merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.112;Burn the witch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.113;Appalling rumors has reached your ears. Your liege has been increasingly spotted coming in and out of one of the most luxurious brothels of the capital, and it is now murmured that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] spends more time whoring than caring about the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.113;A donation will make [Root.GetRandomGodName] extra merciful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.113;Love and be loved in return!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.113;Even if [Root.GetRandomGodName] forgives such sins, I can not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.120;The realm's debt towards foreign banks and crowns is higher than ever. The representatives of those who are owed money are suggesting that if you don't pay them back immediatly they will raise the interest of another 10%. Something we truly cannot afford right now in those times of financial duress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.120;Some more gold will ease their worries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.120;What a bunch of vultures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.120;An extra tax will do the trick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.121;The latest economic policies you suggested are turning out to be much less effective than anticipated. Now the coffers of the realm are empty and many are starting to claim that you are to blame for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.121;My policies are correct, but only in long-term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.121;Economy will recover, but for now I can gather funds for immediate expenses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.121;An extra tax will save our coffers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.122;These are hard times for the realm, a war is going on and the enemies is at the doorstep. Your liege is asking you to find more gold to finance it. After a lot of calculations you realized there are still opportunities to find wealth out there for those who aren't afraid of getting their hands a little dirty in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.122;If we cut some corners here and there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.122;I have a gift for finding gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.122;The smallfolk will understand an extra tax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.123;An increasing number of pious men together with many peasants are starting to complain about the presence of dwarven bankers in the realm, claiming that such practices are no less than the devil's work. They demand that you should make them stop at once, no matter what the repercussions might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.123;They are integral part of our economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.123;After my explanations they will be sure to understand the neccessity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.123;[Root.GetRandomGodName] forbids such practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.124;An envoy of foreign merchants just arrived at court asking for a meeting with the Treasurer straight away. They showered you with gold,  jewels and other valuables and promised a much richer gifts if you were to reach some kind of trade agreement with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.124;We'll take their gifts and smile them away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.124;I can see profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.124;We'll trade their heads on a spike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.125;Your liege's spending seems to be endless. There isn't a day when whole sacks of coins simply not disappear towards another crazy expense making your job as a treasurer twice as hard and thrice as troubling. Something must be done about it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.125;Talk [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] into moderation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.125;I can find two coins for each one [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] spends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.125;I'll scold [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] in front of the entire court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.130;The troops clearly lack even the slightest concept of discipline. They march in queerly formed ranks, are hardly governable and poorly disciplined, not even talking about the way they make camp or the basic lack of everyday drills. Even the weakest of your enemies surely makes sure to have better armies. Something must be done about it and better sooner than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.130;I'll slightly rise their wages to motivate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.130;No lack of discipline will be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.130;A few less heads, a much better discipline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.131;Your quartermaster informed you that the situation with equipment is more than dire. Even the newest swords and pikes are starting to rust from age and the quality of their steel is questionable to say the least. He claims that this situation has been going on for longer than he can recall, blaming it on the lack of resources and skilled men to do the job right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.131;Only the best for my men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.131;I know where to find the coin for what we need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.131;No great steel is needed when [Root.GetRandomGodName] is on our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.140;The guards inform you they just caught a foreign spy trying to overhear the last council session. The guards beat him but he is still alive when you arrived. This little incident could turn out to be more useful than those witless soldiers might think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.140;Torture him to learn what he knows, then throw him in the dungeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.140;Let him go, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.140;His head on a spike is what I want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.141;Your informants have just reported that there is a serious threat to the life of your liege. A few disgruntled nobles and merchants are plotting to get rid of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. It is prudent to act before it's too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.141;Get me definite proof and you will be rewarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.141;There is nothing to fear, God is on our side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.141;The plotters will wake up a head shorter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.142;Some shady people who should have never been trusted are threatening to reveal the contents of a number of letters between your liege and a 'mystery man'. If the contents were to be made public or were to fall into the wrong hands the realm's safety itself and even the life of your liege could be at stake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.142;No one needs to know this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.142;This information in the right hands could make me rich.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.142;Dead men can't speak, can they?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.143;Your liege's spouse has always been known for [Root.Liege.GetHerHimOpp] 'chastity', but now one of [Root.Liege.GetHerHisOpp] lovers is threatening to turn [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] cloak and reveal some secrets to the best bidder. Something should be done about this before it is too late and most of all before it reaches your liege's ear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.143;A fat purse will shut [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.143;If [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] dies I'm the only one left to know.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.143;My daggers are already slashing in the dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.144;Some pious men are starting to doubt your policies as a spymaster, going as far as saying that you are forsaking [Root.GetRandomGodName] for your own goals rather than serving for the best interest of the realm. For how harsh your methods might have been, the realm is safer than ever. You have to address this issue before it turns into something potentially much more dangerous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.144;The realm's best interest comes before [Root.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.144;Faith comes first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.144;I'll talk some reason into those empty heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.145;An enemy spy has secretly approached you, offering to turn his cloak and tell you all he knows about your enemy's weaknesses and plans in exchange for a certain sum of gold and a sanctuary. Your liege wasn't informed yet, leaving you with complete freedom of choice on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.145;We hang traitors around here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.145;Let him spill his beans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.145;I can use him for my own goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDjob.145;He almost had me fooled with this gibberish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.150;An anonymous courier just reached you with what revealed itself to be a more than worrying letter. Someone who signs himself as the 'Peasant Vendicator' claims that your death is near and that your alleged ill-doings as a councillor of the realm will not go unpunished. This might not be a serious threat, but it has to be dealt with nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.150;I'll have a few heads on a spike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.150;I'll have the heralds brush up my reputation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.150;I know people that know where to find those bastards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.151;Your liege has been clear - this is the last time your 'sloppy' policies will be tolerated. 'If you don't change your course of action you will become as expendable as the lamest horse in our stables', those were the exact words. You wonder whether you should apologize or if it wouldn't be a better idea to claim your innocence in the recent mishappenings and hope for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.151;Apologize for my ill doings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.151;It's no fault of mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.151;I'll talk the idiot into sanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDjob.151;I have means to strengthen my position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.152;During the last council you had a very intense discussion with your liege about the different paths the realm should undertake that have left you in fear for your job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.152;Screw [Root.Liege.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.152;A gift should smoothen out our relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.152;I need to apologize before it's too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDjob.152;I'll talk the council to my side;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCjob.153;While travelling in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName] a bunch of desperate peasants assembled around yuor carriage demanding compensations and justifications for the recent policies the realm has undertaken under your supervision. This could very well spark up a revolt so it would be fir bestto  find a good way to deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAjob.153;I'll have their heads on a spike!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBjob.153;Gold will silence them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCjob.153;I'll stumble out an apology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDjob.153;Persuasion is my second name, I'll talk them to my side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
