EVTDESChealth.1;I have to visit my liege, who is currently ill, in order to conduct some official business. I really do not want to go near such a sick person, though - who knows what demons might be trying to possess my liege?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.1;However, I have to finish these errands anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.1;I’ll just not visit. I don’t want demons near me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPhealth.1;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] might catch liege's illness;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.2;Your sickness lingers on, and it is difficult for you to do any of your normal duties at all. Instead, you lie in bed most of the time, sneezing and coughing and feeling miserable all around. You wonder how any work can be done when you’re in such a state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.2;I wish I could get more work done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.2;I can only pray that [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] saves me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTChealth.2;Actually, now I have a good excuse to slack off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDhealth.2;No... I must... try to work... even if a bit...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTEhealth.2;At least I don’t have to deal with annoying people now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.10;Because I am a leper, no one wants to go near me anymore. It’s quite depressing how my friends and family no longer consider me a person they could talk to, and this emotional pain only makes my physical pain worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.10;Why must [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] make me go through this pain?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.10;It is inevitable... I must get used to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTChealth.10;Finally, I can be alone, by myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDhealth.10;I just can’t indulge in sin anymore... just as [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] wanted...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.11;Despite all the excruciating pain you feel as a leper, you have come to realize that this pain only brings you closer to the love of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. You suffer for a reason, after all, and it has made you a better person, in a way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.11;I absolve to live a pure life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.11;I'll devote my time to studying spiritual matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.12;Some days, you just don’t want to live. Leprosy brings you so much pain, from the moment you wake up each morning to when you sleep. Doing any normal activity, such as eating meals, attending to official duties, or getting into bed, brings you so much misery and pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.12;All I can do is pray.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.12;But I still have to attend to my duties, pain or no pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTChealth.12;At least I have my friends to support me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.20;You were just walking down the stairs, carefully measuring your steps due to your blindness. Suddenly, you accidentally overstep and trip, falling down the stairs in one big crash.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.20;Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.20;It doesn’t hurt that much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.21;Ever since I was blinded, I’ve been worried that people might be trying to do things behind my back. What if that servant is actually an assassin with a knife right in front of my face? What if my spouse is having an affair under my nose? What if the peasants are mocking me as I travel the countryside?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.21;I better be careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.21;My friends will be there to help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTChealth.21;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] will protect me from evil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDhealth.21;Even so, no one would dare get on my bad side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESChealth.22;It’s been a while since I was blinded, and I’ve had time to think about what this means to me. In a way, it is rather depressing. Unlike those who were born blind, and never knew of the beauty of the world in the first place, I can no longer witness this beauty - the vibrant colors, the rich and lush images. I miss my sense of vision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAhealth.22;This just makes me sadder and sadder...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBhealth.22;I have to try remembering what things look like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTChealth.22;Perhaps I should sing or compose poetry instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
