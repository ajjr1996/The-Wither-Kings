EVTDESCfeast.1;When preparing a feast even more important than deciding the foodstuff is selecting what drinks to serve. There are so many choices - beer, mead, spirit, cordial, vodka or perhaps even fine wines from Toussaint.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.1;I will have best drinks from all the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeast.1;I will order the best drinks from nearby taverns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfeast.1;I don't want to spend too much on drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.2;I have given the orders for a Great Feast to be hosted in [Root.Location.GetName]. Let the preparations begin...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.2;And all my vassals will be there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.3;The guests has finally arrived! All is ready, the cooks have worked day and night preparing the food, and the servants have scoured the cellars looking for drinks to put on table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.3;Welcome to my feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPfeast.4;is greeted by [Root.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.4;[From.GetTitledFirstName] greeted us warmly to [From.GetHerHis] feast, food was served and the best alcohol was brought  from cellars - Toussaint wine, Redanian spirit and of course mead brewed by the greatest dwarven masters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.4;Thank you for having us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.5;Much thought and consideration had been put into the courses served at [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s feast, but it paled compared to the drinks. The drinks put on table were magnificent, each better than previous and everytig was topped by mead brewed after traditional dwarven recipes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.5;These drinks are heavenly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeast.5;People are in poverty and you spend so much for some drinks?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfeast.5;I will just keep quiet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.6;The courses and drinks at the feast were few but palatable. We were served the best local drinks, but nothing I couldn't get in local taverns. I had expected [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] to serve something more extraordinary at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.6;The drinks is great, [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeast.6;Where's the Toussaint wine?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfeast.6;This is good enough for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.7;Instead of the food and drinks I had thought [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] would serve at [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] feast, we were served just some beer and food that befitted much poorer [Root.Liege.GetManWoman]'s table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.7;The dinner reflects your temperance, well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPfeast.8;[This.GetTitledFirstName] is glad [Root.GetTitledFirstName] liked the food at the feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBfeast.7;Is this what you serve your guests? Shame on you!
EVTTOOLTIPfeast.9;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] complaints about the feast irritates [This.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCfeast.7;It is not my place to criticise [Root.Liege.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.8;[From.GetTitledFirstName] spoke up and told everyone how great the courses at my feast was. I was really glad someone was kind enough to say something nice, given how hard I had worked to ensure that food and drinks was the best part of the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAfeast.8;That was well spoken, thank you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCfeast.9;Some of my guests did not seem satisfied with the courses I served, but I would never have thought one of them would have complained out loud! [From.GetTitledFirstName] said a lot of nasty stuff about the drinks and I couldn't help but feel irritated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
