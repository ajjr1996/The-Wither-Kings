#GREAT SACRIFICE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109018;The great sacrifice continues. As part of today’s ritual, you begin singing hymns to the deities, praying for blessings. As you do this, you bring offerings before the altar, specifically...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109018;Delicious food, for prosperity and wealth;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109018;The blood of sacrificed animals, for glory and honor;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109018;Fragrant perfumes and flowers, for peace and harmony;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109018;Holy water, for good luck and divine favor;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109014;Listening to the chanting and singing of the holy men and women in the midst of the great ceremony brings me peace of mind.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109014;I feel closer to the deities now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109015;While in the midst of prayers for today’s portion of the great ceremony, you feel the presence of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] near the altar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109015;I fear such a higher being and pray for guidance and power.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109015;I respect such a higher being and supplicate myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109016;The entire ceremony so far has been such an inspiring event. I feel so happy, so blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109016;Praise [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109017;While reciting a hymn to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName], you suddenly forget several words and stumble on a line or two of the holy verses.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109017;How embarassing!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109020;The great and magnificent sacrifice to our deities, a days-long ceremony, is under way. May they be pleased with the abundance of our offerings and the melody of our hymns!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109020;Proceed with the ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#BYZANTINE EMPIRE CLAIM;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109019;While the Empire has seen darker days, these are still troubling times indeed, and I feel [Liege.GetTitledFirstName] isn’t the best ruler for the Empire. In fact, I think I would make a much better ruler than [Liege.GetHerHim]. It’s time to get involved in the byzantine politics of the Empire and press my own claim on the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109019;Someday I will sit on the imperial throne!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109044;I have successfully seized the imperial throne for myself.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109044;Let’s hope nobody tries to do the same to me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109044;It is but the will of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109045;With this latest victory you have distinguished yourself as a great leader of armies and none can deny your kingly material. As you and your soldiers celebrate your victory, you can't help but wonder whether you (or perhaps one of your descendants) shall sit upon the imperial throne one day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109045;If only there was an opening on the imperial chair...;;;;;;;;;;;x
#SVRVEY REALM DECISION;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109048;Due to unforseen circumstances, your survey of your realm has been halted.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109048;How unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109049;It’s been many years since I’ve surveyed my realm. Undoubtedly things have changed since then, and some of my courtiers suggest this would be a good time to travel the land once more and see how my realm is doing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109049;I’ll think about it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109050;After deliberation with your advisors and family, you have decided to survey your realm. The preparations will take several days, but the experience will be worth it. After all, it is one thing to hear of how your realm is doing, but another to see it with your own eyes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109050;I cannot wait.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109050;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] makes preparations for the journey.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109051;Readying your horses, carriages, and entourage, you leave your residence early in the morning. You will probably be gone for a month or so as you try to learn more about your realm. What do the nobles do when you’re not around? How are the commoners surviving? Which regions prosper, and which languish?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109051;So many things to find out!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109052;You are about half-way through your survey of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109052;Onward! We still have more traveling.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109053;Your survey of the realm is almost complete. There is only a little bit more traveling to do. It might be a good is time to reflect on everything that has happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109053;Indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109054;Your survey of the realm is coming to a close, and you are almost home. The sight of your residence in the far distance is a welcoming sight, indeed. Nevertheless, you have learned much from your journey, and hopefully these lessons will serve you well in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109054;Still, there’s no place like home.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109055;While traveling, you happening upon a strange merchant from the far east who calls himself “Qi Ma the Liar.” Insisting on speaking in the third person, he greets you while twirling his cat-like whiskers: “Qi Ma knows much, tells some. Qi Ma knows many things others do not.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109055;I’m bored. Let’s see what this eccentric fellow knows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109055;I shouldn’t associate myself with strange references.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109056;Qi Ma says, “So many crusader kings kill their firstborn sons. Some say because he is not as intelligent as the second son. Some say because he is not as strong as the third son. Some say the daughter will make a better heir. Qi Ma is glad his parents loved him no matter what.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109056;Um... I think my parents loved me too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109057;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma loves Europe and the Middle East. Many interesting events that happen to them. Much more than in Cathay.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109057;I sense deja vu.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109057;Wait, didn’t this already happen?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109058;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma has heard that people of the mediterranean are too dark, people of Russia are too ugly, and people of Europe and Middle East all look the same and boring. He has no opinion on the matter. All people are beautiful to him.” ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109058;Definitely.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109058;No. Some are better than others!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109059;Qi Ma says, “Qi Ma always sees Byzantine nobles playing tzykanion in their spare time. He thinks they have nothing better to do when they aren’t being killed by the Fatimids.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109059;Interesting observation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109059;We Byzantines just love our tzykanion.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109059;That’s why the Byzantine Empire was overrun by its enemies?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109060;Qi Ma says, “Some do not know, but the Catholic Church is open-minded on some things more than others. Qi Ma has heard that the Cardinals will elect a Muslim or a nomadic warrior as Pope if they accept a Latin name!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109060;Well, that’s ridiculous.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109071;While traveling in the countryside, your entourage discovers a seemingly abandoned bandit camp. Curious, you explore the camp, only to be immediately ambushed by bandits!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109071;Let’s fight these cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109071;Run away! Retreat!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109072;You and your entourage come across a horrific scene while patrolling some of the nearby roads: an entire caravan of merchants, massacred, possibly by bandits, business rivals, thieves, who knows what! Some of your men suggest you loot all their belongings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109072;Why not? They won’t need their belongings in the afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109072;No. We should give them a proper burial.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109061;A small band of robbers foolishly attacked me while I was surveying my realm! My bodyguards easily defeated them, and the survivors are now at my mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109061;Release and make them vow to find honest jobs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109061;Imprison them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109061;Execute them on the spot!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109062;I and my party come across the skeleton, half-buried in the mud, its hand still clinging onto a sword. This dead man must have bravely fought to the death before meeting an unfortunate end. Perhaps we should give him a proper burial?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109062;Let’s give him a proper burial, first.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109062;Pray for his soul and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109075;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] bury the skeleton and then set up camp for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109075;Saddened that such a man did not receive a proper burial, you decide to properly bury the skeleton yourself. That night, the ghost of the fallen man comes to you in a dream. Thanking for your kindness, he tells you of a small treasure he buried, and its location.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109075;So... he said walk five hundred steps to the north...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109075;It would be dishonorable to steal such a treasure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109063;While surveying the realm, you stay at a small outpost one night. However, you can’t help notice how it is falling into disrepair. Discussing the matter with the outpost’s commander, you learn the outpost doesn’t have the funds for a renovation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109063;How unfortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109063;Give the outpost some funds from your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109063;Bring in expert builders and resources from afar.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109064;You have come to one of the larger settlements in your realm. Tired from all your traveling, you decide to visit the city’s pleasure quarters.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109064;To the whorehouse!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109064;I’ll just get a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109064;A walk and fresh air is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109064;I should go pray at the local church instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE1000109064;I should go pray at the local mosque instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF1000109064;I should go pray at the local temple instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109065;Tonight I am staying in one of the fortresses of my realm. It is a mighty fortress, built with the sturdiest wood and toughest stone, yet to your horror you learn that the warriors guarding this fort are horridly incompetent and untrained - they can’t even hold their swords and spears the right way!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109065;Give funds to assist these soldiers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109065;Bring soldiers and supplies from elsewhere to help.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109065;I should help train these fellows myself!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109066;Your journey through your realm continues. Up ahead, you spot a dirty, impoverished village. Although it is almost night time, and you must find a place to rest, a member of your entourage suggests you move on. “After all, we shouldn’t mingle with these disgusting peasants.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109066;Dirty or not, we’ll rest here tonight.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109066;Let’s leave this stinkhole!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109067;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] rests in the village for the night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109067;Your stay at the impoverished village was worse than you imagined - all the mud, insects, manure, and unidentifiable substances! However, the villagers, honored by your presence, decide to present you with small gifts as you are about to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109067;Refuse it - they need it more than me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109067;Thank you very much.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109067;I demand more!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109067;Let’s give them some of our belongings instead.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109068;Today I am visiting a holy site in my realm. I’ve just arrived, and someone should be showing me around this place anytime soon...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109068;Pray for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109068;Pray all day long.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109068;Offer donations.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109068;Let’s move on, who cares about this nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109069;Today I am stopping by one of my vassal’s residences. However, the food prepared doesn’t taste that good, to be honest. I almost vomited, but managed to trick my host into thinking I was choking on something.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109069;Thank you for the great food!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109069;This ‘food’ tastes worse than manure.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109069;I’ll help them find better food supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109069;I don’t mind the taste. It’s just... different.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109080;While traveling in the forest, you come across a lost child. Crying, the little girl says she was playing with her friends in the forest when she got lost, and she hasn’t been home in several days. After giving her a bit of food, she tells you that she lives in a nearby settlement.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109080;Leave her. She deserves it.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109080;Let’s help the poor child find her way back.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109081;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] and [Root.GetHerHis] entourage escort the little girl back to town.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109081;You escort the little girl back to a nearby city, and learn that her father is in fact one of the wealthiest merchants in the city. Crying tears of joy, the merchant tightly embraces his daughter, before offering you a great reward for finding his little girl.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109081;No need for the reward, I’m only doing my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109081;Why thank you, I am such a good person.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109081;Don’t worry about it, my children are crazy too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109082;While staying at one of the local holdings, I’ve met a talented guard captain. He is quite capable in military matters, despite having lowborn peasants.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109082;Impressive. You set an example for us all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109082;Why don’t you come to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109083;While traveling, your entourage come across what first appears to be soldiers of your realm. After talking with them for a while, you realize they are bandits masquerading as your own soldiers! Where could they have stolen their disguises?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109083;Arrest them!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109084;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s cities. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations townspeople are having outside - the gossip, the rumors, the fears, the hopes, the anger, the happiness, the sadness... There are so many interesting things they say to each other!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109084;Did you know one of the guards used to be an adventurer...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109085;Today I am resting at one of my realm’s villages. Sitting near the window, I can hear the many conversations peasants are having outside. Frankly, though, it’s a little hard to understand the peasants, given they are uneducated and can’t express themselves well, but it’s educational nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109085;Someone saw a crab in the mud the other day, horrible creature.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109086;Today while my entourage and I stopped in one of my realm’s villages, one of the inhabitants ran up to me. He whispered to you how he needed your help, how everybody in the village was conspiring against him. “Come meet midnight behind that building there,” he says. “I’ll tell more. We must not be seen!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109086;Ignore the madman and move on.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109086;Well, I don’t see what harm can come of this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109087;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] meets the town eccentric behind the large building at night.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109087;As the day progressed, you asked the villagers about this madman. They say he’s just the town eccentric, a harmless fool. Nevertheless, when you meet him at midnight, he insists that the villagers are about to kill him. Taking out a large axe, he requests you give him permission to kill them all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109087;Guards! Arrest him! Now!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109087;Ah, let him be, he looks harmless.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109088;While on the road, you come across a traveling merchant who specializes in exotic sweets and delicacies from other lands. Currently he is selling off some of his baklava - syrupy pastries from the eastern Mediterranean - and offers you some at a discount.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109088;I’ll buy some. What is this baklava stuff, anyways?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109088;I’ll buy some. Baklava is great!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109088;I’ll try one or two.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109088;No, I’m not interested.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109089;Today I am traveling alongside some farmland. Suddenly, I come across one of the city boys harassing a pretty peasant girl. Apparently it seems like this fool is trying too hard to win the affections of this girl. Perhaps I should intervene in this amusing scene.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109089;You, boy, stop harassing that girl!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109089;You, boy - learn how to woo a lady properly.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109089;They remind me of my younger self.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109089;Bring the pretty girl to my camp tonight whether she likes it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109090;As I travel on the road today, I’ve come across a wandering musician. He says he can play me a good song if I spare him a coin or two.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109090;Bah, who wants to hear your noise?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109090;Sure, sure - sing, my good man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109091;Listen to the musician sing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109091;The musician’s song is beautiful indeed, an epic, lyrical tale of heroes and villains, love and war, and too many other things to name. ;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109091;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109092;Having traveled for several days, you come across a large estate. Hundreds of peasants are out in the fields, working hard to ensure the crops are taken care of in a proper manner. It is quite a wonder to see where all your food comes from.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109092;This is the glory of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] at work.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109092;An amazing testament of the power of men.;;;;;;;;;;;x
