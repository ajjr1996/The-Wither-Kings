EVTDESCchildhood.1;The adults are so busy, they’re forgetting to get me my food. I want food! I’m so hungry! Why won’t anybody give me food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.1;WAAAH! GIVE ME FOOD!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.1;I’ll just wait. Someone will come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCchildhood.1;I’ll get my own food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.2;While playing around with the other children, you trip and scrape your knee. It’s a small, minor injury, but does it hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.2;BOOHOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.2;I won’t cry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.3;Lately, after hearing the adults talk about this and that and this and that, I’ve started to get really curious about the world around me, specifically when it comes to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.3;Music.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.3;Battling dragons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCchildhood.3;Where the stuff I buy comes from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDchildhood.3;The heavens and afterlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.4;I’m at a feast, and there’s just so many people! I don’t think I’ve ever seen this many people before in my life, it’s overwhelming. Still, there’s so many different people around, doing so many things - I think I’m starting to learn how to properly act...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.4;Friendly to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.4;Sweet and nice to all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCchildhood.4;Rude to fools.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDchildhood.4;Quiet to avoid confrontations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.5;Today my friends and I got hold of some of the court musicians' instruments, and we’re banging and bonging and making loud noises!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.5;Rock on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.6;Your ward, [From.GetFirstName], was caught playing around with the court musician's instruments, making loud noises and disturbing the peace. “They’re rocking and rolling all over the place,” one of your servants complains. “What should we do with them?” You approach your ward and say...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.6;“I don’t mind it much, just do it elsewhere as to not bother others.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.6;“This demonic rocking and rolling or whatever will lead you astray!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.7;I was just having fun, smashing away at the court musician's instruments with my friends, when my guardian has told me, “I don’t mind it much, just do it elsewhere as to not bother others.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.7;Hey guys, I know a good place in the castle basement...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.8;I was just having fun, smashing away at the court musician's instruments with my friends, when my guardian has told me, “This demonic rocking and rolling or whatever will lead you astray!” before subsequently using the strap on me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.8;I better not try that again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.8;I’ll just do it in secret!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.9;A strange noise! What... what is it? “Oh, what is it widdle [Root.GetFirstName]?” my nanny says. “What ish that? It’s a dog. You wuv dogs, don’t you? Dogsh saw bow-wow...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.9;Bow-wow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.9;Stop talking like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCchildhood.9;Please, I already know what a dog is...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.10;“No, no, no,” my nanny tells me. “That’s not how you pray to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. Let’s try again, alright? Repeat after me...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.10;Not these silly words again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.10;Tell me again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.11;You don’t like to talk much, even with your acquaintance. You just know the two of you, despite your mutual insecurity, seem to be able to communicate well without much talking. There’s no doubt both of you are very much attracted to each other. But you are young and bashful, afraid of rejection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.11;I have to show some courage and confess my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.11;I’m too shy. I can’t spit it out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.12;I threw up on someone!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.12;Heehee.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPchildhood.13;Uh-oh...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.13;That little brat [From.GetFirstName] threw up on me while we were dining.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.13;Ew...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.14;Why does the sky have different colors when the sun rises and when the sun sets?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.14;So mysterious....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.20;Today an important foreign dignitary visited the court. Though it wasn’t easy, I managed to impress this dignitary with my ability in conversation. My guardian has taught me quite a lot about talking with others!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.20;I was pretty nervous though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.21;Today an important foreign dignitary visited the court. How impressed I was when my ward managed to engage in a sophisticated discussion with this dignitary. My ward has learned quite a bit about the art of conversation from me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.21;I am very proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.22;Recently, my guardian takes me with [Root.Guardian.GetHerHim] whenever we travel around the country. I hear boring lectures about what people trade, the crops the peasants grow, what happens inside cities and ports…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.22;My guardian says this will be important to me later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.23;Recently, I’ve taken my ward with me when I travelled around the country, visiting different villages, castles, and cities. I constantly explain to my ward how people trade, what sort of crops we grow on the land, and so on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.23;It’s important my ward learns these things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.24;Adults can be so cruel and petty, always scheming against each other for one reason or another! That’s why my guardian takes time to explain to me what exactly they’re up to, so I won’t grow up to be naive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.24;I’ve learned a lot about intrigue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.25;My ward isn’t usually involved in court intrigue, so I fear that the child might grow to be too naive. Thus, whenever some of the other courtiers engage in suspicious activities or gossip, I always make sure to explain their true intentions and schemes to my ward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.25;I do so away from the others, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.26;My guardian is very demanding. [Root.Guardian.GetSheHe] always wants me to read these books or scrolls about boring stuff like "natural philosophy" even though I want to do other things like play with my friends. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.26;Though I will admit some of it is really interesting…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.27;I think it’s important that my ward gain a better understanding of the arts and sciences. A well-rounded person will always do better, after all, so the child is made to read texts on subjects ranging from natural philosophy to history and theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.27;Not that I expect the child to understand it all…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.30;You have seen [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] practising with sword and [Root.Guardian.GetSheHe] is really good. Maybe I could ask to learn from [Root.Guardian.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.30;'Stick 'em with the pointy end!', got it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.31;You have learned how to hold and how to stick things with pointy end of sword from [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName]. Maybe [Root.Guardian.GetSheHe] could teach teach you something more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.31;Okay, 'it's not only about hitting things, but also about no getting hit yourself'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.32;You are quite good with sword, better even then many adults. But you are far from [Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstName] level. [Root.Guardian.GetSheHeCap] could still teach you more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.32;'So it's about timing your hits.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.33;Under my guidance, my young [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is slowly mastering the art of swordsmanship.;Grâce à mes conseils, mon jeune [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], commence lentement à maîtriser l'art du combat à l'épée.;Under my guidance, my young [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is slowly mastering the art of swordsmanship.;;Under my guidance, my young [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], is slowly mastering the art of swordsmanship.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.33;[From.GetSheHe] could become as good as me with practice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.200;You are old enough to finally receive proper education. Who knows where will you study - at court, or maybe from famous general or crafty merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.200;But it's not up to me to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.201;My [GetFromRelation] [From.GetTitledFirstName] is old enough to receive proper education. I have to decide how will [From.GetSheHe] be educated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.201;[From.GetSheHeCap] will be stay at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.201;[From.GetSheHeCap] will study from a merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCchildhood.201;[From.GetSheHeCap] will be groomed for command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDchildhood.201;I have nor time, nor money to spend on this child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPreeducation.202;[This.GetTitleFirstName] will decide if [This.GetSheHe] will pay for [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s education;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.202;My Lord,\n[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is old enough to get proper education, I sincerely hope You will be able to pay for it.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.202;Of course I will pay;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBchildhood.202;No, I will not pay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.203;[From.GetFullName] has agreed to pay for [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.203;That's great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.204;[From.GetFullName] has refused to pay for [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s education. It seems [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] will have to do without it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.204;Cheap...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.210;You are to stay at court and receive education there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.210;Lots of boring, old men...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.211;You will learn from a wealthy local merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.211;Oh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.212;You will be taught to become a great general;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.212;Like in stories?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCchildhood.213;You will not receive any special education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAchildhood.213;Why?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
