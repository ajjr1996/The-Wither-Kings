jewishmarriage.1;I'm about to get married. Hopefully this girl won't be as forceful as my dear mother!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewishmarriage.1a;Oy vey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewishmarriage.2;One of your Jewish courtiers, [From.GetFirstName], is no longer a bachelor. After a traditional Jewish wedding, he is now married to lovely young Jewish woman, who will now join your court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
jewishmarriage.2a;Mazel tov!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109021;While talking with you one day, a servant asks you why we need to have Jews at your court. “Surely,” he says, “You are aware of the danger of these terrible people? We shouldn’t be keeping them here.”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109021;We need educated people, no matter what.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109021;I don’t like them either, but we need them for now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109021;Don’t disrespect any of my subjects, even if they are Jews.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109022;One of my Jewish courtiers is well-known for his great knowledge concerning spiritual matters. Today, out of boredom, we decided to begin a religious debate. So far, it’s been interesting debating against a Jew. As of now, things are starting to get really heated...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109022;But you see, in [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], it says that...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109023;While we disagreed on many points, our dicussion was nevertheless very enlightening. In fact, we were so engrossed in our debate that by the time we finished, it was already sunrise!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109023;It was most enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109024;I should never have this kind of debate again. Our disagreements were too many, and I really felt frustrated with the man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109024;Enough of this.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109023;Debate ends well;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP1000109024;Debate ends badly;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109025;It’s such a nice day outside, but even as I bask in the garden’s sunlight, inside my heart I feel sorrow. Perhaps I should sing the song my mother taught me years ago...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109025;Oh Jerusalem...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109026;Today, while walking in the courtyard, you find one of your Jewish courtiers singing a haunting, ancient Jewish song. Even though you don’t understand it, you feel the sadness, the melancholy, the nostalgia, the sehnsucht of the lyrics. You watch her sing for a while, and after she finishes, you decide to approach her.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109026;Very soothing and soulful indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109026;It sounds terrible, actually.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109026;Actually, I should not be deceived by the music of the Jews.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109026;Wait, I do understand your language. The song is sad, indeed...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109027;While talking with my liege today, the topic of our conversation suddenly switched to finances. Perhaps this is a perfect opportunity to make my request!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109027;Hopefully my liege is in a good mood...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109028;While privately discussing the finances  of your realm with one of your Jewish courtiers, the courtier suddenly makes a request. Nervously, he says: “My liege, the Jewish people are suffering greatly this year, being forced to pay the Jizya tax when we are in such an impoverished situation. To alleviate the problems of the Jewry, would it hurt to slightly reduce this tax?”;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109028;Very well. I will temporarily reduce taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109028;No. Be thankful I don’t treat you like the Christians do.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTDESC1000109027;[From.GetFirstName] has told me that [From.GetSheHe] appreciates that I have been very kind to the Jews in my realm, even inviting some like [From.GetHerHim] to be in my court, and that for this reason many Jews here admire and respect me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTOPTA1000109027;May there be peace among the children of God.;;;;;;;;;;;x
#EVTOPTB1000109027;Just because I don’t treat you badly doesn’t mean I like you.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109029;After having a number of Jews in my court for such a long time, I’ve gotten to know them better, and I’ve begun to reconsider my hatred of them. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions as a Christian has? Perhaps Jews can be good and just people too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109029;No! Such ideas are deceptions by the devil!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109029;Perhaps I shouldn’t be so hardheaded about these matters...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109029;We’re all children of God, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD1000109029;As a just ruler, I must treat all subjects equally, based on their merits.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109030;I’ve just received news that one of my distant cousins is fleeing from persecution in another region. I could take my cousin in, but I’m not sure if my liege is willing too... I’ll just have to wait for a good opportunity to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109030;Oy vey...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109031;A Jewish courtier, [From.GetFirstName], has recently requested that you allow a distant cousins to take refuge in your court. This cousin is trying to flee persecution from another realm, and currently your realm is the only place this cousin could go to... if you allow him to, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109031;Very well. As long as he doesn’t cause trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109031;I can help provide him a temporary home in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109031;I already have enough of your kind here!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109032;My liege is currently very sick, but I know a skilled Jewish physician - a family friend, in fact - who lives in my neighborhood. Perhaps I can recommend him to my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109032;Hopefully my liege will be accept a Jewish physician.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109033;Your illness continues to worsen. However, [From.GetFirstName] tells you of a skilled Jewish physician he knows very well (apparently this man is a family friend). This physician could, hopefully, claims your courtier, heal you of your illness.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109033;Thank you for telling me this. Summon this physician!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109033;No! I don’t want that sort of man near me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109034;Apparently, the Jewish physician is just as skilled as your courtier said. Your illness has completely gone away, and you feel even stronger than you were before your illness started. This must be a miracle of sorts!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109034;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for the physician! Here’s his payment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109034;Please give the physician this gift along with payment.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109034;Request the physician that he stay in my court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109035;The Jewish physician tries hardest to cure your illness, but it seems nothing he does seem to help. Still, you do feel a little better than you did before, at the least.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109035;Oh well. Thank you, nevertheless, my good man.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109035;Fool! Get out! I knew I should have never trusted you!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109035;Imprison and torture the man! He must be trying to kill me!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC1000109037;One of my Jewish courtiers has just returned from the funeral of a family friend. Perhaps I should offer my condolences.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA1000109037;I am sorry for your loss.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB1000109037;You should think about converting now, before it’s too late!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC1000109037;You should have no more tza’ar and only have simchas.;;;;;;;;;;;x
