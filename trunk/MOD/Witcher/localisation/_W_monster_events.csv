EVTDESCmonsters.10;While foraging the battlefield for any reuseable equipment when a hefty silhouette enshrouds you, you turn expecting a comrade, instead you are greeted by the short blunt claws of a graveir tearing across your face.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.10;Alas!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.11;You are informed that while scavenging the battlefield for reusable equipment or survivors one of your soldiers was caught and eaten by a graveir.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.11;I will take care of it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonsters.11;It's too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.12;I loudly proclaimed  that the graveir will be hunted down, but how should I do it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.12;I will hunt it, alone.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonsters.12;I will send my Marshal to hunt it down.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCmonsters.12;I will send a group of soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.13;My liege has asked me to hunt down a graveir on the battlefield that killed one of our soldiers.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.13;Accept;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBmonsters.13;Refuse;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.14;Your Marshal has agreed to seek out the graveir and slay it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.15;Good man, I am grateful;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.15;Your Marshal has refused to hunt the graveir.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.15;How dare he disobey me!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.16;The soldiers you sent have returned victorius, the graveir is dead!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.16;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.17;The soldiers you sent out never returned. Did they run away or did they die in battle against beast you will never know.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.17;Damn...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.18;While terrifying, you charged the graveir and killed it, receiving nought but a few scratches.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.18;Victory!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.19;You charge the beast, after several minutes of brutal combat, you emerge the victor, with several wounds to show for it.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.19;Damn graveir...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.20;Before you can act, the graveir charges and knocks you to the ground, it's large claws tear apart your armor, but somehow, you are able to drive your blade through it's skull drenching your face in it's blood. Several hours later, some of your soldiers pull you out from under the graveir's corpse.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.20;Ugh......;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.21;It is over before it even begins, the graveir smashes you to the ground and proceeds to destroy your armor before sinking it's razor sharp teeth into your throat. No one will ever find your corpse, unless they cut open the graveir's belly.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.22;Your Marshal was able to kill the graveir.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.22;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.23;Your Marshal killed the graveir, but was injured.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.23;Damn...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCmonsters.24;Your Marshal never returned...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAmonsters.24;I sent him to his death...;;;;;;;;;x
