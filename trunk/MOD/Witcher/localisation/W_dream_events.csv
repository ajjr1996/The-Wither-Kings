EVTDESCdream.1;Night falls, and you are quickly asleep as you rest in your bed. In your dreams, you see a great light, an impenetrable, heavenly light. You know not what it is, or even what it represents, but something about it brings you peace and happiness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.1;Is [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] communicating with me...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.2;The cries of fighting men, the splatter of red blood, the clashing of weapons everywhere... You scream and shout in your dream, unaware of your surroundings, of who is your friend and who is your enemy, swinging your sword without regard, lost in your battlerage and the hellish terror that is battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.2;DIE! DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.3;In your dream, you see a tall figure with a golden mask approach, coming closer, and closer, and closer... And then, you are suddenly awakened by your servant. “Wake Up. We're here. Are you ok? Wake up. Stand up. There you go. You were dreaming.“;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.3;What was that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.4;Tonight your dreams whisk you away to the pleasure quarters of a foreign, exotic city. As you go into one of the pleasure houses, beautiful women of all manners and looks flock to you, wearing exotic, revealing clothes. They tug and pull at you, laughing, inviting you to the bedchambers. Is this heaven?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.4;Gah, begone, you hags! I shall not be tempted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBdream.4;Yes, my darlings, my pumpkins, come to Uncle -;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.5;The brothel scene vanishes away, and you now see nothing but clear light. A mysterious woman approaches - the light obscures her face and body, but you feel a sense of ease around her. “Blessed are you who upholds such chastity. You honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] with your strength.”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.5;I... what...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.6;The beautiful women suddenly turn into hideous monsters of all shapes and sizes - crooked fangs, blood-red eyes, dark green skin of ooze and rot, claws like knives. You try to scamper away, screaming, to no avail - they turn on you, their prey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.6;AARRRGGGGHHHH!!!!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPdream.5;Reject these tempting seductresses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPdream.6;Have fun with these beauties;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.7;In your dreams, a dark, sinister hooded figure approaches. His voice is calm and eerily pleasant as he says, “You sleep rather soundly for a kinslayer. That's good. You'll need a clear conscience for what I'm about to propose...” The figure moves closer, and closer, and closer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.7;No! No! GET AWAY FROM ME, YOU DEVIL!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCdream.10;In your dreams, you run through a forest trying to escape your pursuers, sound of hooves from behind you is coming closer and closer. As the riders from behind are about to overtake you, you awaken!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAdream.10;Ah...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
