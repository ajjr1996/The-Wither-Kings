EVTDESCbattle.1;After another heated battle you remember the first time you participated in a war... you have survived so many battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.1;I am a veteran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.2;The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome pagan raider. From Ireland to Constantinople, people fear the name of [Root.GetFirstName], the ruthless plunderer and merciless raider!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.2;Let them fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.10;You hack at the enemy soldier, who falls down, dying. The man shouts “I yield, I yield!” As you take a step back in hesitation, he suddenly lunges at you. Thankfully, you react barely in time, and finish him off with one fell swoop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.10;If he surrendered, I would’ve spared him... what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.10;Mercy is for the weak, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.11;In the morning before today’s battle, your men captured some enemy scouts. They ask you what to do with these unfortunate wretches?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.11;Let them go... after the battle is finished, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.11;Imprison them, insignificant as they might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.11;Kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.12;It is the beginning of the battle, and your men face the enemy, ready for a fight. As you go around inspecting your troops, you happen to engage in conversation with one of your troops, a young, inexperienced squire. As this is his first battle, he is afraid, but also anxious to prove himself. You advise him:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.12;Being afraid is normal - just don’t let it rule you. Trust in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.12;Blood, blood everywhere. Brace yourself for that sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.12;The enemy are men too. Fight mercifully and honorably against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDbattle.12;Kill, or be killed. Remember that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.13;“Curses!” You trip and fall down right in the midst of battle. A nearby enemy notices and takes advantage of the situation. He raises his spear, but just at the last moment, one of your soldiers jumps in between - he is impaled and killed, but gives you enough time to get to your feet and kill the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.13;What a brave man, to sacrifice himself for his [This.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.14;The enemy warrior thrusts at you, but you manage to dodge his attack. Now is the perfect time to strike, when the unfortunate man is vulnerable! “Haha, take that!” you shout, before finishing him off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.14;That was a lucky one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.15;There is a temporary lull in the fighting, a moment of peace. I find a small corner on the battlefield to rest for a few moments. I decide to offer a short prayer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. Moments later, I return to the fray, swinging my weapon at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.15;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on you, because I won't!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.16;One of my guards and trusted companions is struck down in the midst of battle. We manage to pull him to the side, but it is too late. As life begins to fade away from his eyes, I mutter some prayers to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for his sake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.16;My dear friend! But soon I must return to the melee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
