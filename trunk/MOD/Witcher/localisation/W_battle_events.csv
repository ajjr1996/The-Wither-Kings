EVTDESCbattle.1;After another heated battle you remember the first time you participated in a war... you have survived so many battles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.1;I am a veteran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.2;The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome pagan raider. From Ireland to Constantinople, people fear the name of [Root.GetFirstName], the ruthless plunderer and merciless raider!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.2;Let them fear me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.10;You hack at the enemy soldier, who falls down, dying. The man shouts “I yield, I yield!” As you take a step back in hesitation, he suddenly lunges at you. Thankfully, you react barely in time, and finish him off with one fell swoop.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.10;If he surrendered, I would’ve spared him... what a fool.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.10;Mercy is for the weak, anyways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.11;In the morning before today’s battle, your men captured some enemy scouts. They ask you what to do with these unfortunate wretches?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.11;Let them go... after the battle is finished, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.11;Imprison them, insignificant as they might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.11;Kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.12;It is the beginning of the battle, and your men face the enemy, ready for a fight. As you go around inspecting your troops, you happen to engage in conversation with one of your troops, a young, inexperienced squire. As this is his first battle, he is afraid, but also anxious to prove himself. You advise him:;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.12;Being afraid is normal - just don’t let it rule you. Trust in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.12;Blood, blood everywhere. Brace yourself for that sight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.12;The enemy are men too. Fight mercifully and honorably against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDbattle.12;Kill, or be killed. Remember that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.13;“Curses!” You trip and fall down right in the midst of battle. A nearby enemy notices and takes advantage of the situation. He raises his spear, but just at the last moment, one of your soldiers jumps in between - he is impaled and killed, but gives you enough time to get to your feet and kill the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.13;What a brave man, to sacrifice himself for his [This.GetTitle]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.14;The enemy warrior thrusts at you, but you manage to dodge his attack. Now is the perfect time to strike, when the unfortunate man is vulnerable! “Haha, take that!” you shout, before finishing him off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.14;That was a lucky one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.15;There is a temporary lull in the fighting, a moment of peace. I find a small corner on the battlefield to rest for a few moments. I decide to offer a short prayer to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]. Moments later, I return to the fray, swinging my weapon at the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.15;May [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] have mercy on you, because I won't!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.16;One of my guards and trusted companions is struck down in the midst of battle. We manage to pull him to the side, but it is too late. As life begins to fade away from his eyes, I mutter some prayers to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for his sake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.16;My dear friend! But soon I must return to the melee...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCbattle.100;A group of soldiers under your direct command have been accused of the drunken rape and murder of a teenage peasant girl. Having been recognized by the girl's relatives and a bunch of eye witnesses there wasn't much else you could do but imprison them on the spot, and now the peasants are calling for their heads, and their comrades are threatening to revolt if the same request is granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.100;They will be punished, I assure you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.100;It wasn't them, I know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.100;I'll have their manhood on a plate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.101;A sergeant, one of the most skilled if not the best of our ranks, has been seen coming back to his tent with a young lad, who went out by himself this morning, shortly followed by the naked sergeant shouting obscenities about how he was 'robbed' at a certain brothel and about how a 'cunt' has more balls than the lad does. While his fondness for women was always in doubt, now it is hardly ignorable and some men are growing itchy of being under the command of someone they 'don't trust their arses with'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.101;I won't allow queerness in my ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.101;He's a good sergeant, that's it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.101;For [Root.GetRandomGodName]'s sake, behead this abomination!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.102;The most recent inspection of our stables reported an appalling situation: most of the horses are either lame or too old to be decently ridden, and the ones that could be magnificent beasts are poorly nourished and scarcely ever cared for. The knights are complaining, claiming that they won't be able to face any more battles if they don't have reliable mounts below them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.102;The best knights deserve the best mounts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.102;Only those who can afford it will have a new mount.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.102;They are just as lame as their riders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.103;A small number of the newer recruits disappeared during the night, only to be caught by our scouts whoring and on their cups in a nearby village. They even drunkenly admitted that theirs was no less than a desertion, and that they had no intention of ever coming back to our ranks. Normally I would have their heads on a plate, but in those dire times we may need any avaiable and willing man to our side..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.103;The lash will suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBbattle.103;Who am I to judge them instead of God?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCbattle.103;Their heads will show the others what happens to deserters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.104;The army camp has been struck by famine and disease! Many soldiers are dying and many others are far too weak to keep on fighting, and you yourself feel like burning inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.104;Alas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.105;Most of camp provisions have gone bad, leaving many soldiers dead or dying. You're still wondering whether you ate some of that ominous stuff yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.105;Alas!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.106;A petty discussion between one of our sergeants and a bowmen degenerated into a large scaled riot inside the camp! Some tents are on fire and some brave men surely lost their lives driven by the fumes of alcohol and stupidity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.106;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.107;Fire! Fire in the camp! The tents are on fire, and most of provisions are menaced by a treacherous fire that sparked up from a careless campfire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.107;To the buckets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCbattle.108;In the distance a banner rises strong and mighty, with a small army marching behind it. It's your arms, reinforcements have finally arrived!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAbattle.108;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
