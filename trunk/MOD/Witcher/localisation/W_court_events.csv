EVTDESCcourt.1;One of my courtiers has challenged me to a drinking contest. I have a good feeling I can best the fool!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt.1;Let’s go for it!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcourt.1;I do not engage in such dangerous behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPcourt.2;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] wins the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPcourt.3;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] loses the contest.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcourt.2;Gulping down the last mug of alcohol, you grin at your courtier, who happens to be pass out. Then, you pass out yourself. At the least, you’ve won the drinking contest!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt.2;Wait... wha... MORE! YES! MORE!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcourt.2;Oh... never again...;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcourt.3;Your head hits the table as you pass out, while your courtier chugs down another mug of alcohol. You’ve lost the drinking game!;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt.3;Wha... what happened? Where am I?;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcourt.4;Your courtier stumbles in, drunk again, screaming obscenities and random gibberish as you attempt to hold court. Everyone looks at the drunkard for a while, before glancing back awkwardly at you as they await your reaction.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt.4;Punish the drunk with fines.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBcourt.4;Haha, what a fool! How amusing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCcourt.10;A while back I sentenced a commoner to death for a heinous crime. Today, I’ve just learned he was actually framed by a rival. Though I have arrested and ordered the execution of this rival, the wrongful execution of an innocent man is a stain on my honor and ability as a ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAcourt.10;Not good news at all.;;;;;;;;;;;x
