EVTDESClovers.1;My lover is quite demanding, so aggressive, so lustful - it’s quite difficult to keep up at night! Even worse, my beloved now wants to try out even more passionate things in our bedchamber. What can I do? Am I not really that satisfying?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.1;I’ll try as hard as I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlovers.1;Come on, dear, nice and easy - prolong the pleasure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClovers.1;I know of some exotic techniques from the far east...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClovers.2;Even though everyone’s aware of our love, our chaste behavior is a source of mockery and ridicule. Just the other day, I overheard one of the servants laughing: “They can’t even hold hands, for fear they will sin!” I’ve got to do something about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.2;I’ll to be a bit more physical...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlovers.2;I’m happy with our love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClovers.2;I’ll spread rumors about my amazing abilities in the bedchamber.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClovers.3;Smiling, your lover leans on you. Your world is at peace - all the worries and troubles gone, vanished, no more, at least for now. But this ethereal serenity is suddenly interrupted when your lover asks, out of nowhere: “I’ve been wondering, dear... why do you love me?”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.3;You look so lovely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlovers.3;You’re a great toy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClovers.3;You have a great personality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClovers.4;My constant public displays of affection with my lover seem to be getting out of hand, if one of my courtiers is to be trusted. This courtier had the audacity to suggest that we were going to far. “Touching, feeling, hugging, groping, and kissing in front of everyone - you must stop it, it’s embarrassing us all!”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.4;We’ll stop it all at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlovers.4;We’ll try to act more modestly in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClovers.4;Now, see here, at least we’re not copulating in public!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClovers.5;The two of us are widely known for being virtuous, good people. We both get along pretty well, furthermore. Why don’t we have a closer relationship to begin with?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.5;I’d rather not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBlovers.5;I’d rather we become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTClovers.5;I need someone like that in my life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESClovers.6;Your workload has been very light recently, and you’ve taken the opportunity to spend more time with your lover. Tonight, the two of you are playing around on your bed, when your lover suddenly remarks, rather alluringly, “Remember the first time we made love on this bed? That was so wonderful, when you...”;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAlovers.6;Who says we can’t relive that experience, right now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
