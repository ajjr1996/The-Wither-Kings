archery_competition_title;Archery Competition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.1;I have sent forth messengers around the realm to spread the word that an archery competition will be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.1;The competition begins soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.2;A courier has come forth inviting all nobles of the realm to attend an archery competition, the like of which is only seen once per reign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.2;A chance to prove our worth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtournament.2;Just a waste of time for fleeting glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.10;It is time to let the competition begin and for the next 2 months let all show their skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.10;It is the time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBtournament.10;Sadly a small war will delay this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.12;As I draw my last breath I remember the competition. Alas, my death will set stop for the festivities and I grieve for myself, to think I will never be allowed to see the nobles show their pride and skills with bows!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.12;I hope my subjects will remember me as a benevolent ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.13;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName], due to [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s untimely death the competition unfortunately has been cancelled.\n\nSigned, \n[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.13;And I had so looked forward to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.11;The archery competition of [From.GetTitledName] has been cancelled due to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.11;Then my skill will be shown in battle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.100;Victory is mine, I hit the target in straight center from all the distances proving once and for all that none can match my skill with bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.100;Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.101;[From.GetTitledName] has been crowned the winner of my archery competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.101;[From.GetSheHeCap] truly deserves it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.102;Although I hit the target from all the distances, not all my arrows were in center, still I was good enough to be declared second.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.102;Glory to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.103;[From.GetTitledName]'s skill won [From.GetHerHim] second place in my archery competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.103;A most valiant performance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.104;A honorable third place was the result of my efforts in the competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.104;Good but not good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.105;[From.GetTitledName] fought [From.GetHerHis] way to the third place in my archery competition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.105;And fought hard [From.GetSheHe] did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.200;The competition was going well when the arrow I shot somehow curved and ricocheted off a wall. The next thing I knew it had hit me in knee, I stumbled and fell down. When I awoke I was maimed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.200;Bad luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.201;I was carefully aiming at the target and finally ready to hit it, when I heard scream from behind me to "Duck!". Before I could react a stray arrow hit me in shoulder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.201;The Wound, the wound!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.210;I was taking part in the competition and enjoying the camaraderie with the other entrants when a queer feeling came over me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.210;I dare not speak its name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.211;Archery competitions are such fun, and it is not just the taking part, there are other entertainments available too... I was enjoying one such entertainment. Then I noticed a strange sore on my body in a place I would much rather not mention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.211;Probably nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.212;The competitions did not go well, but not badly either. I had prepared for months for this and at the end of the day I was simply not good enough. I had turned to solace in drink. When it was over a few morning later I felt terrible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.212;One more drink won't hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.220;While I was at the competitions some lower class type with pretensions insulted my honor. Although sword were not part of the competition, they were the only way to settle this matter. Naturally he was no match for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.220;I learnt something about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.221;I and some like-minded fellows who had already dropped out of competition too were not happy with how it ended. We decided to go on a little hunt in the nearby forest, we had everything we needed for it on hand already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.221;I learnt something about myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.230;I was taking aim, when it dawned on me that it didn't actually matter. I won't have time to aim forever in real battle. I just let the arrow fly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.230;A miss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.231;Others who stood beside me had already taken their shots at their target, while I still was just aimed. They were getting bored, some were even starting to 'boo' me. Only after few minutes when I had carefully consider wind direction did I let the arrow fly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.231;A perfect hit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.240;I was at the competition and although I did not have an opportunity to distinguish myself in it, I was sitting around and listening two nobles plot together to advantage themselves at the next distance. I listened carefully to their plan and I instantly saw a flaw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.240;Intriguing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.241;I was at the competition and although I did not have an opportunity to distinguish myself in it, I was sitting around and listening to two nobles plot together to advantage themselves at the next distance. I offered some advice, how was I supposed to know?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.241;Oops!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.242;While at the competition I was listening to some noble describe how he collected tithes from his serfs. As I listened I realized he was giving his serf plenty of ways of avoiding giving their due.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.242;I kept this knowledge to myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.243;While at the competition I joined in a conversation with other nobles on how best to collect tithes. I saw a far easier way and it caused quite an argument with many of them disagreeing with my stance, but the more I talked the more I convinced myself that I was right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.243;But I am right, aren't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.244;I was simply passing time at the competition when I saw two nobles argue over honor. I knew straight away that the argument was spurious and the result would be unnecessary bloodshed. So I stepped in prevented it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.244;I am more diplomatic than I though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.245;I was simply passing time at the competition when I saw two nobles argue over honor. I knew straight away that the argument was spurious and the result would be unnecessary bloodshed. I attempted to mediate the dispute and they told me that at least one of them should survive the resulting duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.245;Oh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.300;The competition is over and now it is time to bask in the glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.300;A glorious event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.310;The competition ends and although I may not have won any of the top places my prowess did not go unnoticed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.310;But of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.311;The competition ends and I have shown time and time again my skill with bow, even if I did not win I still covered myself in glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.311;Glory to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.312;The competition ends and it was a terrible, especially when I hit the target next to mine. I still hear their laughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.312;It was shameful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.313;The competition ends and I couldn't hit the target even once. Personally I blame the bow, it must have been tampered with, but people did not see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.313;I know they snigger behind my back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.314;The competition ends and although I did not win I feel I leaned from other participants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.314;It was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCtournament.315;The competition ends and my skills were poor, people doubt my abilities now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAtournament.315;Oh dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
